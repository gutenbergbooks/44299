<br />THE THREE-BLADED KNIFE</h2>
<p>Florence Huyler took one look at
the Chinaman. He was wearing a long
yellow coat and carrying a huge yellow umbrella.
His back was toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be sure,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;If&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused, uncertainly. In a moment he
would move, and then she would know&mdash;by
his ears.</p>
<p>Again, for a moment, she gave herself over
to a study of the magnificent panorama that
lay before her. She was poised, like a pigeon
in a belfry, but oh, so high up! Six hundred
and twenty feet in the air, she could look down
upon every skyscraper in the city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>She had been doing just this until her eyes
had fallen by chance upon this Chinaman.
She had been looking for a Chinaman, looking
hard&mdash;for a Chinaman with prodigiously
long ears. But she had decided to forget him
for a time, to enjoy the Sky Ride and its observation
towers. And now here he was,
haunting her still.</p>
<p>The Sky Ride! Ah, there was a marvel indeed!
Eiffel Tower, not the Ferris wheel,
could be compared with this. Two steel towers
reared themselves to dizzy heights. Between
these there were steel cables. And darting
from one tower to the other over these
cables, like veritable rockets which they were
made to represent, were cars of steel and glass
from which one might view the magnificent
spectacle of the fairgrounds at night. All
aflame with a million lights, truly alive with
a hundred thousand merrymakers, the grounds
seemed a picture from another world.</p>
<p>With great eagerness she had paid her fee
and entered the express elevator to go shooting
upward toward the stars.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>She had decided not to take her sky ride
at once. Truth was, Fate had decreed that she
should not take it at all that night. This, of
course, she could not know. So, quite joyously,
she had shot up and up until she was at
the very top of that steel tower.</p>
<p>She had shuddered as she left the elevator.
The tower appeared to sway, as indeed it did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if, by some secret power of rhythmic
motion, it should be made to sway too far?&rdquo;
she whispered to herself now. &ldquo;What if it
should swing and swing, and at last bend and
bend&mdash;then go crashing down!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; She got a grip on herself.
&ldquo;That could not happen. This is one of the
marvels created by our American engineers.
They figure and figure for days and days.
Then they set mill wheels revolving, turning
out steel. They send steel workers to their
tasks, and here we are. Nothing could go
wrong. It&rsquo;s all been figured out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having settled this problem to her own
satisfaction, she walked to the rail and began
studying the city she had learned to love.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It looks so strange!&rdquo; she told herself. And
so it did. Streets were steel-gray ribbons
where automobiles, mere bugs all black, blue
and yellow, crept along, blinking their fiery
eyes.</p>
<p>Her eye was caught by twinkling lights atop
a skyscraper.</p>
<p>Drawing forth her binoculars she focussed
them upon that spot. Then she laughed. Atop
that skyscraper was a home, a pent house, a
gorgeous affair that shone like marble. About
it, all gay with flowers, was a garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A garden party,&rdquo; she whispered, as if
afraid they might hear. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the reason for
the strings of lights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could see graceful women in gorgeous
gowns with men all in white and black evening
dress swaying to the rhythm of some entrancing
music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are rich,&rdquo; she thought to herself.
&ldquo;Bankers, perhaps, or managers of great corporations.
Members of Society spelled with
a big S. They don&rsquo;t know I am looking at
them.&rdquo; She turned away again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well!&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;Even a mouse may
look upon a queen. If&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had the tower indeed begun to sway in an
ominous manner it could not have startled her
more than the vision that met her gaze. The
little yellow man in the long yellow coat had
turned about. She could see his ears now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;the long-eared Chinaman! I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
got him!&rdquo; she hissed.</p>
<p>At that instant the wind blew his long yellow
coat aside, exposing to view the hilt of
the three-bladed knife. And in the hilt of that
knife jewels shone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke too soon, for without appearing
to see her at all the man glided to an elevator
and before she could cry: &ldquo;Stop him!&rdquo; shot
downward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she breathed, and again, &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next instant she too had leaped to an
elevator and went shooting down after him.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get him yet!&rdquo; But would she?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>Even as her elevator shot downward from
those dizzy heights, she had time to think of
the circumstances leading up to this, one of
the most thrilling moments of her not uneventful
life.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>It had been night, deep, silent, mysterious
night, when first she had seen that three-bladed
knife, and the long-eared Chinaman. No
stars had shone. No moon had cast its golden
gleam across the black and sullen waters of
Lake Michigan. From afar, as in a dream,
seated with Petite Jeanne, her companion, on
the sand before a little fire of sticks, she had
caught the ceaseless rumble of the city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hour of enchantment, it is near at
hand,&rdquo; Jeanne, the little French girl, murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;the hour of enchantment?&rdquo; Florence
murmured after her. Not understanding, but
being too full of dreams to care, she said no
more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my good friend, Florence Huyler, the
enchanted hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more the little French girl lapsed into
silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>Florence moved her lips as if about to speak.
But she remained silent. Why break a magic
spell with mere talk?</p>
<p>And to her this was indeed a magic moment.
For hours, earlier in the day, she had listened
to the roar of the greatest carnival the world
has ever known. About her had swarmed a
thousand children. Brown heads, golden
heads, laughing eyes, weeping eyes, dancing
feet, all that goes to make up a host of youngsters
on a holiday. And every day was a holiday
on the grounds of this great show.</p>
<p>Nor did Florence miss a day of it. Indeed
she could not, for she was a part of it.</p>
<p>On her ear drums had beat the noisy blare
of the merry-go-round and the shrill whistle
of the miniature train, the hilarious shouts of
the joy-makers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she breathed, &ldquo;it is night. They
are home, tucked in bed, those blessed children.
I have only to rest here by the fire with
Jeanne.&rdquo; She threw out her splendid arms
in an air of abandon, then curled herself up
on the dry sand before the fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Only just look!&rdquo; Jeanne began all over
again a moment later. &ldquo;See what I found to-day
in the chest. That last one we bought; the
oh, so mysterious chest with a dragon on its
cover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her hand she held an object that cast
back the light of the dying fire.</p>
<p>For the moment Florence could not be
roused from her dreamy stupor. Never had
she worked so hard as on these days of the
great Fair. Never had life seemed so full of
joy. Jeanne was with her once more; a whole
half year the French girl had been in her native
land. Now she was back. There was, too,
a spirit of glorious madness about this great
exhibition, that somehow entered into her very
soul. Cars packed with screaming visitors
rocketing across the sky, airplanes drumming
and dipping, speed boats thundering down the
lagoon; speed, light, joy&mdash;who could resist it
all?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>But when day was done, the throngs departed,
it was good to pick up a few broken
bits of wood, kindle a small fire here on the
beach and play the vagabond through one wee
hour of the night. To sip black tea, to stare
at the fire, to dream&mdash;who could ask for more?
And yet here was Petite Jeanne insisting that
she &ldquo;only look.&rdquo; Look at what?</p>
<p>Ah, well, Jeanne had not worked that day.
She had no need to work. She was rich. Fortune
had overtaken her at last&mdash;given her a
chateau in France and much else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne,&rdquo; she grumbled like some good-natured
bear, &ldquo;you have been curled up among
the pillows all day, petting the cat. And now
you ask me to look, to think&mdash;I, who have done
nothing all day but lead children in play,
march them up the magic mountain and down
again, lift them on the little train and off
again, follow them on&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Jeanne stamped her pretty foot. &ldquo;It
is enough. I would not say &lsquo;Look&rsquo; but it is
yours, yours and mine, this curious dagger.
You must tell me what it is. Only see! It has
three blades!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dagger! Three blades!&rdquo; Florence found
herself at last.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes! Three blades! A very strange
dagger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thing Florence took from Jeanne&rsquo;s hand
was indeed a curious affair. A knife with a
hilt of ordinary length, it had not one blade,
but three, extending in triangular formation,
ten inches from the hilt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; Florence declared emphatically, &ldquo;is
something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And see the handle!&rdquo; Jeanne was her old
enthusiastic self. &ldquo;See how it shines in the
light! Jewels, some red, some white&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glass, I suppose.&rdquo; Absent-mindedly Florence
drew one of the white spots that glistened
in the light across the crystal of her
watch. Then she sat up quite abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dumb! Now I&rsquo;ve scratched my crystal and
it will break. Jeanne! Don&rsquo;t ask me to buy
another chest. No need to buy trouble. That,
at least, you may get free.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But see!&rdquo; Jeanne snatched the curious dagger
from her. &ldquo;If it indeed scratches glass,
then truly it is a diamond. And see! There
are one, two, three, four&mdash;oh, how is one to
count them? There are many jewels, and they
go round and round the handle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diamonds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Surely! They are diamonds. And the
red ones are rubies. Half belong to you and
half to me. For see, we bought the box together,
the box with the dragon on the cover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly!&rdquo; she cried, dancing across the sand,
waving the dagger over her head. &ldquo;Truly this
is for me the hour of enchantment!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; The little French girl&rsquo;s voice
changed abruptly. She held up a hand.</p>
<p>From somewhere in the distance came the
slow <i>D-o-n-g, D-o-n-g</i>, of a clock striking two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The enchanted hour!&rdquo; Her tone was solemn.</p>
<p>Once again she swung her hands high. Next
instant a sharp cry escaped her lips. The three-bladed
knife with all its jewels was gone.
Some one half concealed in the darkness at
her back had snatched it from her.</p>
<p>It was the stout Florence who sprang to her
feet and, but for Jeanne, would have dashed
away in mad pursuit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>But Jeanne prevented this. She leaped forward
just in time to seize her friend about the
waist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! My friend, you must not! You
will be killed! He has a knife!&rdquo; she exclaimed
in a hoarse whisper. &ldquo;He has that dagger with
three blades! You&mdash;you have nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have my two hands!&rdquo; Florence continued
to struggle. &ldquo;He is small, only a little Chinaman.
I&mdash;I saw him. I&rsquo;d break his back if he
did not give me the knife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But think!&rdquo; Jeanne loosed her hold as Florence
ceased to struggle. &ldquo;It is only a dagger,
a dagger I found in a box, and we paid so
little for that box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a dagger with a hilt encrusted with
jewels!&rdquo; Florence dropped to her place beside
the dying fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rich for a moment,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;then poor
forever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll know that man if I ever see him
again,&rdquo; she added hopefully. &ldquo;He had the longest
ears of any person I ever saw. He wore
an orange-colored cap, and there was a bit of
bright glass&mdash;oval-shaped it was&mdash;shining
from his forehead. And those ears!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Who could mistake them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will find him. Truly we must!&rdquo; Jeanne
spoke with confidence. &ldquo;This is the enchanted
hour. My enchanted hour!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>And now, twenty-four hours later, shooting
down, down, down, a hundred, two, three, four
hundred feet, Florence was in pursuit of that
very long-eared Chinaman. From his belt had
shone the jeweled hilt of the three-bladed
knife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ours!&rdquo; she muttered low to herself.
&ldquo;Jeanne&rsquo;s and mine. I&rsquo;ll get him yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But would she?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span>
<br />THE SKY WALK</h2>
<p>As she boarded the down-going car, the
girl&rsquo;s mind flashed through the incidents
leading up to this strange chase, and then
came bang up against a problem with no certain
answer. Should she leave the car at the
two hundred foot level, the spot from which
the cars of the Sky Ride went flashing away
into the night, or should she ride to the ground
level?</p>
<p>Following instinct, when she reached the
Sky Ride level she darted from the car. At
once she caught her breath. There was the
long-eared Chinaman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>The instant she saw him he was on the
move. There was no mistaking the look in her
eyes. She meant to have that three-bladed
knife. He made no mistake about that. Imitating
a monkey, a spider and a snake all in
one, he managed by curious contortions to
make his way past the waiting rocket-car and
out upon the cables that carried the cars on
their exciting journey.</p>
<p>At once the place was in a panic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A car from the other side will come and
crush him! He will fall! He&rsquo;ll be electrocuted!&rdquo;
came from the crowd as men fought for
a spot where they might view the impending
catastrophe.</p>
<p>But no catastrophe occurred&mdash;at least not
at once. Standing with the air of a tight rope
walker, which indeed this long-eared one must
have been, he unfolded his large yellow silk
umbrella; then, apparently all unconscious of
the shouting throng, he turned and walked the
cables as another person might walk the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If another car comes&mdash;&rdquo; Florence came
near to wishing she had stuck to her resolve
and made it a night of pure pleasure.</p>
<p>No car came from the other side. A quick-witted
guard had stopped it in the nick of
time, by a phone call.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>So the little yellow man in a long yellow
jacket with a three-bladed knife in his belt
balanced himself with his yellow umbrella and
proceeded blithely on his way while an ever
increasing sea of faces gazed upward.</p>
<p>Great searchlights began playing upon him.
Like fingers they pointed him out. Ten thousand,
twenty, fifty, perhaps seventy thousand
pairs of eyes were fixed upon him.</p>
<p>Not one of all these people, save Florence,
knew what it was all about. &ldquo;Is this one more
feature, a grand surprise in this the grandest
of all shows?&rdquo; This is what the thousands
were asking.</p>
<p>Other questions occupied Florence&rsquo;s mind.
What did the man mean to do? Did he know
himself? How was it all to end?</p>
<p>The suspense continued. It is well that it
did. The first few hundred feet of this curious
person&rsquo;s sky walk was over the solid earth.
Beneath him was the gasping multitude.
Jammed together in one solid mass, not one
of them could have moved had this sky walker
come hurtling down from those dizzy heights.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>He did not fall. Instead, with all the grace
of a fine lady out for a promenade, he moved
along the cables that, being all but invisible
in the night, made him seem to walk on air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he were only over water!&rdquo; Florence
spoke without meaning to do so. &ldquo;Then there
would be some chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At two hundred feet?&rdquo; some one doubted.</p>
<p>All the same, Florence waited and hoped.
&ldquo;Now he&rsquo;s a third of the way to the place
above the lagoon,&rdquo; she assured herself. &ldquo;Now
half&mdash;now two-thirds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She caught her breath. Something was happening.
The man was seen to teeter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he falls&mdash;&rdquo; She set her lips tight. &ldquo;If
he does, if he falls and kills some one, I shall
never forgive myself. A knife!&rdquo; She all but
said it aloud. &ldquo;A knife with a diamond-studded
hilt&mdash;what&rsquo;s that to a human life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the man had regained his poise. He was
tripping along as before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he&rsquo;s almost there,&rdquo; she sighed, as a
low prayer escaped her lips. &ldquo;He&mdash;he must
be over the water. Thank&mdash;thank God!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>But, after all, what <i>did</i> this astounding person
propose to do?</p>
<p>Did he plan it, or was it the work of Fate?
Perhaps no one will ever know. Be that as it
may, just as he reached a spot above the center
of the lagoon the man was seen once more
to waver.</p>
<p>This time he did not regain his poise, but
with a movement that seemed half a leap, half
a fall, launched himself into mid-air.</p>
<p>Florence closed her eyes. She opened them
at once to find the Chinaman still going down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how remarkable!&rdquo; she breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the umbrella,&rdquo; some one at her side
volunteered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s made for that purpose, like
a parachute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not give the information that, as
far as she could tell, the man had entertained
no notion of making that unusual journey.</p>
<p>She continued to watch while the Chinaman
plunged downward. With his fall checked by
the umbrella, he had, she believed, a fair
chance for a safe landing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; Some spirit inside her appeared
to ask the question. &ldquo;Why, then,&rdquo; she
answered the spirit, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be after him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chinaman disappeared into shadows
that lay above the surface of the lagoon.</p>
<p>At once spotlights were playing upon the
water. If he came to the surface no one saw
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; Florence assured herself, &ldquo;there
are a hundred boats out there on the lagoon.
A man with such a trick as that in his bag
must have others. He need only come up
alongside a boat, cling there until the excitement
is over, then go on his way. We shall
meet again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not to-night,&rdquo; she amended, as she
surveyed the dense throng below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So here&rsquo;s for a sky ride!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave herself over to the joyous excitement
of the hour.</p>
<p>Curiously enough, upon descending from
the steel tower after a half hour of shooting
through space, she bumped squarely into her
roommate and pal of many strange adventures&mdash;Petite
Jeanne.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jeanne!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I have found
him, the little Chinaman with long ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the knife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He still has it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about it,&rdquo; Jeanne begged.</p>
<p>In her own truly dramatic style Florence
told the story. &ldquo;And when he dropped,&rdquo; she
ended breathlessly, &ldquo;I said &lsquo;that&rsquo;s the end of
him!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was not?&rdquo; Jeanne breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not sure it was not. We shall see him
again, perhaps many times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Florence, why does he want that
three-bladed knife so very, very much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is set with jewels,&rdquo; Florence spoke slowly,
&ldquo;but there is something more. I am sure
of it. Perhaps something quite terrible. I saw
it in his eyes. He&rsquo;d kill some one to possess
that knife, if necessary. I am quite sure of
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, oh my Florence, you must be careful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will be careful. But we shall have the
knife. It belongs to us. We bought it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jeanne agreed, &ldquo;we bought it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Jeanne closed her eyes she could see the
place of purchase, a long, low auction house
blue with tobacco smoke; a bald-headed auctioneer
shouting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three dollars. Who&rsquo;ll make it three-fifty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Chinaman in an obscure corner was bidding
against her for that chest with a blue
dragon on the cover.</p>
<p>Sudden confusion. Three men dragging the
protesting Chinaman away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did it all mean?&rdquo; she asked herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;we got the chest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a thought struck her all of a heap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;there were other
things in that chest. Oh, so many more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Other things?&rdquo; Florence fairly sprang at
her. &ldquo;Why did you not tell me? Is it still in
our room under the bed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Oh, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we must hurry home. They may be
in our room at this very moment, those little
yellow men, carrying the chest away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Jeanne exclaimed. &ldquo;Let us hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span>
<br />FOOTSTEPS ON THE STAIRS</h2>
<p>All her life Florence had lived in the great
and noisy city.</p>
<p>Not so Petite Jeanne. If you have read of
her at all you will know that as a child she had
been a vagabond with gypsies of France, a
very beautiful vagabond, an accomplished
dancer, but a vagabond all the same. How
this slender, golden-haired child of France
came to America and how at last France discovered
her once more and carried her back
to be the mistress of a grand old chateau is
no part of our story.</p>
<p>It was enough for Jeanne that she was here
with her good pal Florence, that they lived on
the top floor of an ancient rooming house,
that they might come and go as they pleased,
and that if she chose she might once more turn
vagabond for a day, a week, or a month.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>For the moment she was interested most of
all in this vast and most marvelous of all carnivals,
the Century of Progress. For many
this was not a carnival at all, but a serious attempt
to place before man&rsquo;s eye all the stupendous
achievements of mankind. For Jeanne
it was a vast carnival, a place to enjoy one&rsquo;s
self, a thing of beauty and a joy forever.</p>
<p>Now as she tripped along at Florence&rsquo;s side
she whispered: &ldquo;See! Are not those steel towers
mysterious? They are like fingers pointing
to the stars we do not see because the clouds
hide them. And the little rocket cars waiting
there&mdash;they seem ready not just to carry you
over to the island of enchantment, but on and
on through the sky to the moon, to Venus, to
Mars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, oo, la la! Here I am dreaming again.
We must hurry. Those terrible Orientals may
be turning our room upside down this very
moment.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>More often than not, in this life, it happens
that the thing we most expect does not happen
at all. With breath coming quick and short
Petite Jeanne and Florence climbed the four
flights of stairs leading to their room only to
find everything as they had left it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Jeanne breathed. &ldquo;There is no one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One would think,&rdquo; Florence laughed, &ldquo;that
you were disappointed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no!&rdquo; Jeanne made a face of horror.
&ldquo;What could one do if she were to find her
room filled with queer little yellow men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw them down the stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, you&mdash;you who are always tumbling
around in a gymnasium. But poor little
me? Bah! It is quite im-poss-i-ble. I am glad
they are not here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, see!&rdquo; The little French girl&rsquo;s voice
changed. She dragged a curious box-like trunk
from beneath the bed. &ldquo;See what we have
here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had the worst time getting it open, this
box,&rdquo; she complained. &ldquo;The locks, they were
strong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, look!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>She held up a curious sort of banner on
which was pictured a Chinese lady holding out
her hand so that a flock of bright colored butterflies
might light on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a dusty Chinese banner!&rdquo; Florence
was disappointed. &ldquo;Is there anything else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many more like this. Always the picture
is different. I love them. They are so odd!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may have them.&rdquo; Florence was very
weary. She began disrobing for the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See! Here is a jolly little bell!&rdquo; A mellow
tinkle rang out.</p>
<p>Florence laughed. &ldquo;Bronze. You can buy
one just like it at the Chink store on Wabash.
It&rsquo;s too bad, little old sister.&rdquo; She put her arms
affectionately about her slender companion.
&ldquo;We have lost the best thing&mdash;a three-bladed
dagger set with rubies and diamonds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But cheer up!&rdquo; She tossed back the bed
covers. &ldquo;To-morrow will come. And after that
another to-morrow. I shall never forget that
long-eared Chinaman. And if we meet!&rdquo; She
made a gesture of violence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; she added as she crept into bed,
&ldquo;there are many more boxes to be sold in the
future. Better luck next time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>Scarcely had her head touched the pillow
than she was fast asleep.</p>
<p>Jeanne did not sleep. There was no need.
For was she not at heart a gypsy? And did
not gypsies sleep when the spirit moved them
to do so? Twenty hours in one long sleep and
after that, if opportunity presented itself,
twenty hours of adventure.</p>
<p>Ah, yes, no rising at seven to gulp down
toast and coffee, then to dash for a train.
Jeanne was a real vagabond. Curled up among
the cushions in the sunshine, she had slept long
hours that day.</p>
<p>So now she dragged the mysterious box into
their tiny living room and spread its highly
colored banners on every available piece of
furniture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;they are grotesque.&rdquo;
She was studying a picture, all done
in some form of needlework, the picture of a
god with a dozen arms and quite as many legs.
&ldquo;But then, they are beautiful, too. What gorgeous
tapestries they would make!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>She was thinking now of the all too bare
walls of the great living room in her own castle
in France.</p>
<p>She had not found being rich in France a
joyous business, this Petite Jeanne.</p>
<p>In France if you are young and you are rich,
then you are watched over by a mother or perhaps
an aunt (Jeanne had an aunt). You must
see certain people. You must not see others.
You must not wander away alone. You must
not&mdash;oh, no, my dear, you must not&mdash;speak
to strangers! No life was this for a sweet and
beautiful vagabond like Petite Jeanne.</p>
<p>So, when Florence had written her a glowing
letter telling of the city of many marvels that
was spreading itself fairy-like across the
waterfront in Chicago, she gave her chateau
over to a caretaker, bade him allow all the
good children to play on her grounds and in
her forest at will, then took a ship for America
and her beloved big pal, Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she sighed happily, &ldquo;here I am.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here&mdash;&rdquo; Her tone changed. &ldquo;Here you
are.&rdquo; She was addressing the box of mysteries.
&ldquo;One would think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>She broke off short to stand on tiptoe like
a bird poised for flight. Had she caught a
sound from without, a shuffling of soft-padded
feet on the stairs? Ah, yes. There! A board
creaked.</p>
<p>Snapping off the light, she stood in the darkness,
tense, alert, listening intently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That box!&rdquo; Her thoughts were in a tumult.
&ldquo;Why do they want more? They have the
best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I throw open the door and thrust the
box at them?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, no, I shall not do that. Mystery, how
one yearns for it! And yet how one dreads it!
This box, it is ours. We have bought it. We
will fight for it. I will call Florence. She will
throw them down the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no! She is weary. They may have the
knife. The lock is strong. Let them spy upon
us if they must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne was by nature a child of the night.
To sit there in the dark, to think and think,
to wait and wait for that which in the end did
not come, was no hardship for her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>The first faint gray light of dawn was creeping
upon the towers of that magic city on the
shores of Lake Michigan when at last she parted
the curtains to look away at the land and
the black waters that lay beyond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bon jour</i>, sweet world!&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;Now we have a new day. And to-night I
shall go out alone to seek adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that she shoved her pink toes beneath
covers of silk filled with eiderdown and slept
the sleep of perfect peace, while out there by
the shores of Lake Michigan fifty thousand
happy people romped through the sunshine
of a bright summer&rsquo;s day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br />THE GOLDEN TEMPLE</h2>
<p>Why did Petite Jeanne sleep all day to
haunt strange places in the night?
Who can say? Why do certain birds deep in
the forest sing only at night? Why do all
manner of wild things choose the night for
their joyous frolics? Jeanne was as wild by
nature as any of these, for had she not lived
the very early years of her life with the gypsies?
And is it not at night that the gypsies
dance, sing and tell fortunes round the camp
fire?</p>
<p>She did not leave her room, this little French
girl, until night shadows had fallen and automobile
lights like twin stars were blinking
their way down the boulevard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>When she did leave she carried a well filled
laundry bag. Yet, strange to say, she did not
carry this bag to a laundry depository, but to
a hotel two blocks away. Here she entrusted
its care to a smiling check boy. The boy&rsquo;s
smile broadened when she slipped him a bright
new dollar bill with a whispered,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may not call for it for oh, so long. You
keep it till I come. Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy grinned and nodded. Such occurrences
were not new to him. Many young
ladies entrusted their secrets to him. &ldquo;But
this girl,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;is different. I wonder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had little time to wonder. He thrust
Jeanne&rsquo;s bag far back in a deep recess and
straightway forgot it; which is, after all, just
the proper thing for a check boy to do.</p>
<p>Jeanne did not leave the hotel at once; instead,
she took the elevator to the top floor,
then walking to a window, looked away toward
the lake front.</p>
<p>Though she had looked upon the scene before,
she could not suppress a low exclamation
of awe: &ldquo;Magnificent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The city of a million lights!&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>It was all of that and more, this great Century
of Progress. And night was its time of
entrancing beauty. Tall towers glowing like
shafts of white hot metal, great structures
changing color like giant chameleons, now
pink, now yellow, now pale blue, fountains of
fire leaping up from the gleaming surface of
the lagoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is like the end of the world,&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;All is on fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To her ears, like the roar of a distant cataract,
came the sound of it all. She seemed to
catch the whistle of rocket cars as, gliding over
steel cables, they carried screaming joy riders
through space to the distant island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How marvelous it all is!&rdquo; she murmured
again. &ldquo;To think that only a short time ago
there was no island, that ships came to anchor
where now ten thousand children play!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jeanne&rsquo;s eyes did not linger on the Sky
Way where rocket cars glided nor the waters
where fiery fountains played. Her eyes had
come to rest at a spot close to Soldiers&rsquo; Field
where a low roof cast back a gleam of gold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Golden Temple of Jehol from that enchanting
land of mystery, China!&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;I shall go there to-night. It may be
that there I shall learn much regarding that
very curious chest, those banners and that ancient
three-bladed dagger with all those jewels
in the handle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be!&rdquo; She shuddered in spite of herself.
&ldquo;It just may happen that there I shall find
the little Chinaman with those so very long
ears. And if I find him? Ah, then what shall
I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was not one to worry much about what
should be done under certain circumstances,
this little French girl. Inspiration of the moment
should guide her. Tripping lightly to
the elevator door, she went speeding downward
and was soon on her way to the Golden
Temple of Jehol.</p>
<p>On entering the Golden Temple Jeanne
found it all but deserted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she breathed. A spell seemed to take
possession of her. She wished to turn about
and go away from this place of mellow lights
and silence; yet some mysterious power held
her.</p>
<p>Before her, seeming alive in that uncertain
light, a fat Buddha sat and smiled. Beyond
were all manner of curious objects, trumpets
three yards long, miniature pagodas, images
of gold and bronze, a great bell suspended
from a frame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;is a Chinese Temple.
Every part of it, twenty-eight thousand
bits of wood, was made in China.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if taking up the story, the low melodious
voice of a mandarin talking to three ladies in
black said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything you see here came from the
temples of China. Everything. They are all
very old and quite priceless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne moved toward him. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he went
on, appearing to see her out of the corner of
his eye, &ldquo;is a prayer wheel. Inside this wheel,
which is, you might say, like a brass drum, are
bits of paper. On these are written one hundred
million prayers. See!&rdquo; He spoke to
Jeanne. &ldquo;Turn the handle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>The girl obeyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;you have said one hundred
million prayers. Is it not very easy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne favored him with one of her rare
smiles. This chubby mandarin in his long robe
could help her. &ldquo;He is not that one who stole
my dagger,&rdquo; she assured herself. &ldquo;His ears are
quite short. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her thoughts broke short off. Her eyes
opened wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&mdash;where did that come from?&rdquo; She
was pointing to a three-bladed knife lying on
a low bench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; the mandarin went on in his slow,
melodious voice, &ldquo;like all the rest, came from
a temple. It is very old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May&mdash;may I see it?&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s heart
throbbed painfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you may see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held it out to her.</p>
<p>She did not take it. &ldquo;That,&rdquo; she said more
to herself than to him, &ldquo;is not the one. There
are no jewels in the hilt, only gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No jewels?&rdquo; The small eyes narrowed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have seen one set with jewels, diamonds
and rubies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where is it now?&rdquo; The mandarin
strove in vain to maintain his Oriental calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; Jeanne shrugged her shoulders.
She had said too much. &ldquo;A&mdash;a Chinaman
had it. He is gone. I know not where.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mandarin went on telling in his slow
way of the treasures in that golden temple;
yet it was plain that his mind was not upon
the ancient bell, the miniature pagoda nor the
smiling Buddha. He was thinking of that
knife with a jeweled handle, Jeanne was sure
of that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how much he knows,&rdquo; she
thought to herself. &ldquo;Could he help us find that
long-eared one? I am sure of it. And if he
did? Ah, well, what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the end she decided that she dared not
trust him, at least not yet.</p>
<p>For some time she lingered in that place of
soft lights and silent footsteps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>When at last with a sigh she prepared to
drag herself out where humanity flowed like
a great river, she dropped a coin in the mandarin&rsquo;s
hand and whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will return again, and yet again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-e-s.&rdquo; The mandarin&rsquo;s tone was barely
audible. &ldquo;Those who reveal dark secrets are
often richly rewarded. It is written in a book.
You have said one hundred million prayers.
You will not forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was about to leave the place when again
her mind received a shock. Because the light
was dim, she had not observed until now that
the walls were hung with banners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are like those in the chest!&rdquo; she told
herself with a sudden shock. &ldquo;They belong to
some temple. Were they stolen from a temple,
all those, the knife, the bell, the banners?
And did the thief, after bringing them to
America, fear to claim them? Is that why we
were able to buy them at that auction house
where unclaimed goods are sold?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, it must be so! There was an Oriental
bidding against us. Some strange persons
came and dragged him away, the secret
police, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was trembling from head to foot. What
strange Oriental mystery had caught her in
its web? What intrigue had she but half unearthed?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; She took a strong grip on herself.
&ldquo;It is nothing. This place, it gives me strange
ideas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These banners on the wall?&rdquo; She spoke in
the casual tone of an inquisitive visitor. &ldquo;Are
they also very old?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many are very old.&rdquo; The mandarin was
smiling again. &ldquo;These were made by rich Chinese
ladies who wish to have the gods be very
good to them. They are all made by hand,
embroidered with gold and silver thread.
Worth many dollars, very, very many dollars,
each one of these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne asked not another question. She had
had enough for one night. Never before had
she so wished herself in the outer air.</p>
<p>She was nearing the door when a voice she
had not heard before said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like a book telling of the Golden
Temple?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned quickly to find herself looking
into the face of a man, and at once she knew
that here was a person well worth knowing.
He was large, well built, muscular. His face
was brown, the brown of one who lives in the
out-of-doors. His hat was drawn low over his
eyes, yet he did not inspire her with fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-yes, I would like a book.&rdquo; She held out a
quarter. &ldquo;Do you know China?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was born there.&rdquo; The man spoke in the
steady, even tone of the white man who has
lived long in strange lands. &ldquo;Until six weeks
ago I lived in China.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;then perhaps you can help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gladly. How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&mdash;another time.&rdquo; Once more Jeanne felt
she had spoken too soon.</p>
<p>Without a backward look, she left the place
to lose herself in the merry-mad throng that,
whirling and swirling like autumn leaves
caught in a gust of wind, revolved about the
entrance to the million dollar Skyway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V</span>
<br />A HEARSE IN THE MOONLIGHT</h2>
<p>Petite Jeanne, too, seemed a bright
autumn leaf as, dressed in a filmy orange-colored
gown, she drifted down the broad
paved walk.</p>
<p>Passing a great building that gleamed from
within as if it were on fire, she marveled at the
mystery of light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I find myself intrigued by a
mere Oriental dagger and one small Chinaman
with long ears?&rdquo; she asked herself, &ldquo;when a
thousand mysteries of science, chemistry,
light, heat and sound lie all about me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finding no answer to this question, she still
kept a keen watch for that long-eared Chinaman
who had snatched the jeweled dagger
from her hand and later had walked the cables
of the Sky Ride.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is like a Chinaman to have three blades
to his knife where only one is needed,&rdquo; she assured
herself. &ldquo;But why must one have a dagger
in a temple? I&rsquo;ll ask that interesting white
man who sold me the book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed she would, and many other questions
besides. &ldquo;There is a destiny that shapes our
ends, rough hew them though we may.&rdquo; The
men we meet and pass, never to meet again,
the ones who because of a passing word become
part of our very lives, all their names are
written in a book, and the name of that book
is <span class="sc">FATE</span>.</p>
<p>A long, low bus, looking for all the world
like a mammoth greyhound, stopped at
Jeanne&rsquo;s very feet. Because on the long seat
filled with smiling people there was room for
one more, Jeanne paid her fare and took her
place with the rest.</p>
<p>Where was she going? She did not know
nor care. Some time perhaps she would take
this exhibition seriously. Time enough for
that. The whole summer was before her, fifteen
glorious weeks. For the moment she
would wander at will.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>Gliding along in the bus she lost all sense of
time until, with a start, she found herself at
the far end of that all but endless pageant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu!</i>&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Why did I
come all this way? Florence is waiting. She
will never forgive me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Climbing aboard a second bus, she went
gliding back the way she had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear!&rdquo; she cried as she sighted her
good friend seated in a camp chair, watching
the fading lights. &ldquo;How can you forgive me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not so hard,&rdquo; the big girl drawled.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been sitting here half asleep, watching
the throngs pass by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Jeanne,&rdquo; her tone became
animated, &ldquo;people come a long distance from
north, south, east and west, thousands of
miles, to view the wonders of this place. And
who can blame them? But, after all, when
they are here, throngs and throngs of them,
they themselves are more interesting than all
the marvels they come to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes. It is so.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, Florence!&rdquo; Jeanne cried suddenly. &ldquo;I
have found such a charm of a place! And we
may dine there if we hurry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but I fear the buses are stopped. See,
all the lights are fading.&rdquo; Her voice dropped.</p>
<p>It was true. The lights were fading. Here
a brightly illuminated tower went dark, there
a fiery fountain became a well of blackness,
and there an endless chain of light vanished
into the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is like the end of the world!&rdquo; Jeanne said
in an awed whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this place you speak of? Is it far?&rdquo;
Florence sprang to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, very far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we will go. I am tired of seeing and
hearing. A long walk will be just grand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, ah! to see this place by moonlight!&rdquo;
Jeanne clasped her hands. &ldquo;That will be so
very wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The broad, paved way, where thousands
had wandered during the day, was all but deserted.
Here a belated visitor hurried toward
a gateway. There an attendant, his labors
over, raced away to catch a home-bound car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>Down by the shore a score of camp fires
were gleaming. For the first time in many
years Indians were camping on Chicago&rsquo;s
water front. The wavering light of their fires
turned their tepees into ghost-homes of the
long ago.</p>
<p>Farther south other fires gleamed about the
temporary homes of other wild men from faraway
lands. All these were a part of the great
show.</p>
<p>But it was none of these that had caught and
held the little French girl&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>Before them loomed the Midway. With
lights out, its fantastic structures, standing
out black against the sky, seemed huge beasts
come to life from the past and now crouching
by the roadway in their sleep.</p>
<p>As if feeling something of this, Jeanne
quickened her pace. But not for long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Down here it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned sharply to the right, hurried forward
twenty steps, then halted before a door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is closed!&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;Can it be?
Yes, perhaps. See! The electric light is out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, no. There is some one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a scrub woman.&rdquo; Florence pressed
close to the glass door.</p>
<p>Just then the person inside stood up. Florence
caught her breath. She had not been
wrong. The one who stood there had been
scrubbing. Her dress was pinned up; her arms
were bare to the elbow. But surely she was
not a regular scrub woman! Seldom had Florence
seen a more beautiful face. She was
young, too, surely not yet twenty. Cheeks
aglow with natural bloom, big eyes shining,
brown hair tossed back, she stood there smiling,
a picture of natural youth and beauty.
Smiling at what? Had she seen them? Yes,
she was coming to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to come in?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>Too astonished to answer, the girls found
themselves inside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>The place they had entered was a long, low
room. The floor was of rough boards. Massive
beams ran from one end to the other of the
paneled ceiling. At one side was a curious sort
of refreshment stand, and to the right of this
the broadest fireplace Florence had ever seen.</p>
<p>Noting the surprised look on Florence&rsquo;s face,
the girl said: &ldquo;Have you never been here before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>By her rich, melodious drawl, Florence knew
at once that this girl came from the southern
mountains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; the girl went on, &ldquo;is the Rutledge
Tavern. It was by this fireplace that the young
man, Abe Lincoln, sat and talked for long
hours to a girl with hair like corn tassels in
autumn. Can you see them there now? She
is sewing. He is dreaming of days that are to
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So this is the spot that charmed my little
French friend,&rdquo; Florence whispered to herself.
&ldquo;Little wonder! Coming from the past with its
simple grandeur, it has an appeal all its own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d like to
sit here by the fire. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll soon be through
with my work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you,&rdquo; Florence exclaimed, &ldquo;surely you
do not have to scrub floors all night long!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! Not all night long. Only this one.
And I love it!&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s eyes shone. &ldquo;I am
Jensie Crider. I am from the mountains of
Kentucky. This is the Lincoln group. And
Abraham Lincoln, our great President, came
from the mountains where I was born. They&mdash;they
let me care for these buildings because
I understand how they should be kept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; Her voice fell to a whisper. &ldquo;Come
back here and you shall see those other buildings
by the moonlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She led the way to the back of that long
room, then pointed silently. Standing there,
bathed in the golden moonlight, were two
small log cabins and a rough structure built
of boards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That little cabin,&rdquo; the girl whispered, &ldquo;is
the one in which the great President was born;
no, not quite. It is exactly like it, but for me
it is the same.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Does it not seem wonderful?&rdquo; Her low
voice was singing now. &ldquo;No windows, a stick
chimney, a clay floor. He was born there, the
great President. He was one of us, of our
poor mountain folk. Do you wonder that I
love my work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Florence whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look!&rdquo; Jeanne gripped her companion&rsquo;s
arm. &ldquo;What is that strange thing over there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&mdash;&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s tone changed. &ldquo;That
is a very old hearse. Perhaps it is the one that
carried our martyred President to his grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hearse!&rdquo; Jeanne shrank back. &ldquo;A hearse
in the moonlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; said Florence. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and sit
by the fireplace and dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do!&rdquo; The mountain girl&rsquo;s voice rang
with hospitality. &ldquo;I have some corn bread, the
sort we make in the mountains, baked in an
oven under the coals. I&rsquo;ll make some tea very
soon, and we shall have a bite to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To sit in the Rutledge Tavern, beside the
fireplace where Abe Lincoln and Ann Rutledge
had made love long ago! Could anything
be more romantic?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>A moment more and they were there, Florence
and Jeanne, staring dreamily at the fire.
But try as she might, Jeanne could not quite
drive from her mind the image of that ancient
hearse standing out there in the moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems a sign,&rdquo; she told herself. A sign
of what? She could not tell.</p>
<p>The mountain girl&rsquo;s corn bread baked in a
Dutch oven beneath the coals was delicious.
Buried in strained honey which, Jensie Crider
assured them, came from a bee tree away up
on the side of Big Black Mountain, it was a
dish to set before a king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those other buildings there,&rdquo; Jensie explained
in a quiet voice, &ldquo;one is the home of
Abe Lincoln in Indiana and the other, that one
built of boards, is where Lincoln and Berry
kept store, or tried to and failed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m sort of glad they failed.&rdquo; Her voice
trailed into silence. On the broad hearth the
coals glowed. Behind them, down the long
room, all was shrouded in darkness. And still
in the golden moonlight the dilapidated hearse
stood. Jeanne thought of this, and shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; It was Florence who spoke at last.
&ldquo;Why are you glad that Lincoln failed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because he is my hero,&rdquo; Jensie&rsquo;s tone was
deeply serious. &ldquo;And if my hero never failed,
how could I hope to be like him? We all fail
sometimes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all these buildings,&rdquo; she went on after
a time, &ldquo;I have the little cabin where he was
born. I was born in just such a cabin, way up
on the side of Big Black Mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s eyes opened wide. &ldquo;And is
that your home now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! Now we have two rooms and two
real glass windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Jensie half apologised, &ldquo;that
isn&rsquo;t very much. But there&rsquo;s a porch to sit on
all summer long. And oh! it is beautiful in the
mountains in the springtime. When the dogwood
blossoms are like drifting snow on the
hillsides, when little streams covered over with
mountain ivy come dashing, cool, damp and
fragrant, from far up the mountains, oh, then
it is a joy to live!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come and see me there some time?
You two?&rdquo; Her voice rang with eagerness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; Jeanne cried impulsively, throwing
her arms about the girl and kissing her
apple-red cheek. &ldquo;Yes, indeed! We will come
in spring when the dogwood is in bloom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again silence settled over the room
where darkness played hide and seek with
little streaks of light among the massive hand-hewn
rafters.</p>
<p>Only an ancient clock in a far corner disturbed
the silence with its solemn <i>tick-tock,
tick-tock</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Jeanne gripped Florence&rsquo;s arm.
The clock made a curious noise like a very old
man clearing his throat, then struck twice:
<i>Dong! Dong!</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Two o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo; Jeanne sprang to her feet.
&ldquo;Two o&rsquo;clock! This is my hour of enchantment!
We must be going!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo; Once again she embraced the
mountain girl. &ldquo;We will be back. Many times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She led Florence out into the moonlight.
But even as she did so she cast an apprehensive
look behind her. She was thinking still
of the hearse in the moonlight. A fence hid it
from her view. With a shudder she exclaimed,
&ldquo;Come! Let us go fast!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br />&ldquo;THE CHEST IS EMPTY!&rdquo;</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne, you left the door open!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Standing on the stair landing before the
door to their apartment, Florence gave her
companion a reproving glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I? Leave the door open?&rdquo; The little French
girl was vigorous in her denial. &ldquo;To be sure I
did <i>not</i> leave it open. I closed it tight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Florence, catching her breath,
&ldquo;some one has been here, may be here yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they are here still, you may throw them
out of the window. See, you have my permission.&rdquo;
Crowding past her, Jeanne entered
their living room and snapped on the light.</p>
<p>What she saw caused her to hold up her
hands in horror. The place was in the wildest
state of confusion. Cushions had been dragged
from sofas and chairs, beds tumbled about,
dresser drawers emptied on the floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; Jeanne sighed, &ldquo;they are gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the chest!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed. &ldquo;That
Oriental chest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chest is empty, to be sure.&rdquo; Jeanne
threw back the lid. &ldquo;What would you have?
They came for that which was in the chest;
nothing more. Why then would they not take
it if they found it here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; Florence sat down to stare at the
chest. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t feel so sorry about that.
After all, what use could we have for some
dusty old Chinese banners and a silly little
bell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What indeed?&rdquo; There was a curious light
in Jeanne&rsquo;s eye that Florence did not quite
understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Jeanne!&rdquo; Florence sprang to her feet.
&ldquo;If those people found what they wanted in
the chest, why did they take the trouble to
tear this place up so terribly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s eyes were veiled,
dreamy now.</p>
<p>When order had been restored, Florence retired
for the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>Jeanne sat up for a long time studying. She
was reading the book she had purchased in
the Golden Temple of Jehol.</p>
<p>As she read her wonder grew. From her
reading she learned for certain that the embroidered
panels that had but yesterday reposed
in the now empty chest had indeed come
from the temples of China&mdash;not one, but many
temples; that they had been made of gold and
silver thread. When she recalled them one by
one and attempted to compute their value, it
made her a little dizzy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; she sighed at last, &ldquo;it is not so
much what one possesses that counts; it is
what he is able to sell it for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did you come to Chicago?&rdquo; She
addressed the chest. &ldquo;You have no address
on you. No, not one! I scoured you clean.
You have only a dragon on your cover. Did
some one steal all those priceless things? And
were they afraid at last to claim them in America?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>Once again she recalled the circumstances
under which she had bought the box. Both she
and Florence had long haunted auction houses.
Once she had bought an ancient gypsy god.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did that cause me trouble!&rdquo; she exclaimed
in a whisper. &ldquo;Oo, la, la! But it was
great fun, and very mysterious, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now there is this box.&rdquo; She kicked the
thing with her toe. &ldquo;It was lost in the express
with no label on it, the auctioneer said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made a bid. A Chinaman raised me. I
bid again. Once more he raised. There was
murder in his eye. And then&mdash;&rdquo; She paused
for breath. &ldquo;Then some officers in plain
clothes came and carried him away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor fellow! It is hard when you wish very
much to buy a package so mysterious, and you
cannot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; she added after a moment, &ldquo;perhaps
it was to him not so mysterious after all.
Possibly he knew what was in the chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, we will keep an eye out for that
one with the long ears. And if we find him?
What then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unable to answer this question, she crept
into her bed and fell asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>Next day she spent three hours alternately
laughing and crying over Sandburg&rsquo;s life of
Lincoln called <i>The Prairie Years</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, now I understand it all,&rdquo; she sighed,
as she wiped her eyes after reading the chapter
telling of the love of young Abe for Ann
Rutledge. &ldquo;Who would not gladly scrub the
floors of those buildings where our little Jensie
Crider labors? And yet, how I love her
for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this day Florence was given the surprise
of her life. And to Jeanne a bright new dream
was born.</p>
<p>Florence was on her way to work on the
Enchanted Island. She was about to start
across the bridge over the lagoon when she
saw some one leaning on the rail looking away
at the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Jeanne!&rdquo; she exclaimed in a whisper.
&ldquo;What in the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tiptoeing up to the girl who was looking
away from her, she seized her by the shoulders
as she fairly shouted in her ear:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne! How did you get here? And where
did you get that jacket? It&rsquo;s a peach!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taken by surprise, as she undoubtedly had
been, the girl did not so much as start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s not Jeanne!&rdquo; Her voice was icy
cold. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s got you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come on, Jeanne,&rdquo; Florence laughed,
looking her full in the face, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t fool
me! But, honest, where <i>did</i> you get that
jacket?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sudden and quite surprising light overspread
the other girl&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; There was a ring in her voice now.
&ldquo;I told you the truth the first time. My name&rsquo;s
not Jeanne. But say! Do you mean to tell me
there&rsquo;s a girl in this city that looks so much
like me that you really can&rsquo;t tell I&rsquo;m not that
girl even when you look me square in the
face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence stared at her in blank amazement.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not Petite Jeanne, the little French
girl, who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Lorena LeMar, the movie star. Surely
you must recognize me from the screen!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry. I seldom go to the movies.&rdquo;
Florence looked her apology. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m convinced
now, and I&mdash;I apologise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was about to pass on when the other
girl seized her arm eagerly. &ldquo;Who is this
girl? Has she been in the movies? No, of
course not. Could she act a part, do you
think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl seemed so much in earnest that for
a moment Florence could only stare.</p>
<p>When at last she found her tongue she assured
the young movie star that while Jeanne
had never appeared in the movies she was
quite capable of acting a part, that she had
once starred for an entire season in light opera
and that for one glorious night she had sung a
stellar part in grand opera.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you believe in luck?&rdquo; the girl demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mostly in the luck that comes after a lot
of hard work,&rdquo; Florence smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes you get the breaks. You can&rsquo;t
deny that,&rdquo; the girl insisted. &ldquo;Might as well
call it luck. Who is this friend of yours? Does
she like acting? Does she need money? Is she
a kindly person? Would she throw a rope to
a drowning soul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mostly yes,&rdquo; Florence smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead me to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t now. Going to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over on the Enchanted Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When can I see her then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At eleven to-night, at the Rutledge Tavern
in the Lincoln Group.&rdquo; Florence was thinking
fast. She must be on her way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&mdash;that will be swell. Here, shake on
it!&rdquo; The girl gripped Florence&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;You
won&rsquo;t fail me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence went dashing across the bridge.
All the way over she was saying: &ldquo;What does
it all mean? What can she want of Petite
Jeanne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No answers came to her, but deep in her
soul was the conviction that Jeanne was in for
one more novel adventure, and the sort of adventure
she loved, at that.</p>
<p>Still, she had not guessed the half of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br />THE PLACE OF DARKNESS</h2>
<p>Florence never tired of her work on the
Enchanted Island. On this island which
man by his ingenuity and tireless energy had
drawn from the very bottom of the lake, children
romped while their elders sought amusement
to their own liking.</p>
<p>Florence loved small children. With their
gay frocks, their tossing hair, their frank
smiles, she found them entrancing. Just to
watch over them as they rode on gay launches
or diminutive motor buses, or laughed at the
talking cow and the puppet show; to climb
with them the magic mountain where all manner
of strange people from fairyland awaited
them; then to call all this work and to receive
money for it on pay day&mdash;this to her seemed
absurd.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>And yet this was her manner of spending
her day on the Enchanted Island. So absorbed
in it did she become that she all but forgot to
call Jeanne and tell her of the strange appointment
she had made for eleven o&rsquo;clock
that night.</p>
<p>At four she did think of it, and at once
dashed to the telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jeanne!&rdquo; she exclaimed, as a voice
came to her over the wire. &ldquo;Are you there?
I&rsquo;ve got exciting news. We are to meet a
movie queen at the Rutledge Tavern to-night&mdash;eleven
o&rsquo;clock. You&rsquo;ll be there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of a certainty!&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s tone was eager.
&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t know. Good-bye. See you
at eleven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hung up, leaving the little French girl
in a state of bewilderment, her mind all awhirl
with questions. Who was this movie person?
Was she truly a queen of the cinema? Why
must she meet her?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>There was some question in the end regarding
Jeanne&rsquo;s ability to keep this engagement.
This, fortunately, was outside her knowledge.
So, having eaten a very good dinner at the
hotel, and having bestowed a knowing look
upon the check boy, custodian of her mysterious
laundry bag, she made her way to the fairgrounds
and for a time purposely lost herself
in the vast throng that, eddying now this way
and now that, poured like a river down the
broad walks running for miles along the lake
front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; she mused as, jostled here and
pushed aside there, she moved forward, &ldquo;how
a rain drop feels when it falls into the center
of the great Mississippi. Snuggles right down
and makes itself feel right at home. Surely
this is so. And I, wandering here with this
throng from all over this broad land, feel as
if I had been too long away from it all, as if
in some other world I had marched on and
on, on and on with a vast throng that, like the
Milky Way, moves forward forever.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>The ebb and flow of that great human tide
at last carried her to the Golden Temple. And
here, more by instinct than desire, she sought
once more the cool silence of a place where
worship seemed the mood of the hour.</p>
<p>Sinking into a chair, she sat in a dreamy
mood listening to the low, melodious voice of
the mandarin. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;is the
laughing Buddha, god of happiness. Wart on
temple stands for nobility. Long ears, long
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glancing up, Jeanne saw the long ears of
this grotesque idol, and laughed. &ldquo;Long ears,
long life,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;There is one Chinaman
who needs to avoid Florence if his life
is to be long. She&rsquo;d throw him into the lagoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mandarin was continuing his chant.
&ldquo;The three-bladed knife is not for to kill. Oh,
no, he is for drive demons away. Always ring
little bell, swing three-bladed knife through
the air. Demon go away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Demon very bad. Make people sick. Make
people die. Make land dry. Rice not come up.
Millet not get ripe. All people starve. Oh, yes,
demon very bad!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>He turned to the prayer wheel. Jeanne
ceased to listen. &ldquo;So that is the meaning of
the three-bladed knife and the bell,&rdquo; she was
thinking to herself. &ldquo;How strange! I wonder
if the demons flee if the knife is flashed through
the air and no bell rings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more the stream of humanity called.
Again she lost herself in that great rushing
river. Nor did she emerge until she stood before
an immense affair that, seeming a prodigious
barrel one hundred and twenty-five
feet high, stood out against the night.</p>
<p>As she stepped inside this gigantic barrel
her mind went into a tailspin. Had she passed
into another world? It seemed so.</p>
<p>The inner walls of that great barrel were
all alive. Here she looked deep into the heart
of a tropical jungle where giant tractors
dragged great mahogany logs through the forest,
there a magnificent trans-continental limited
leaped at her from the mouth of a tunnel,
and here, sailing high over the white vastness
of Arctic wilds, a splendid airplane came to
rest on an endless expanse of snow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>That it was a trick performed by the miracle
of a hundred moving picture projectors she
knew right well. Yet it did not destroy for her
the sense of illusion.</p>
<p>She stood there lost to the world about her,
entranced, when with a sudden shock she felt
a hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p>Turning quickly, she found herself looking
into the mask-like face of the long-eared
Chinaman.</p>
<p>So sudden was the shock that she thought
she might fall to the floor or scream.</p>
<p>But she did neither. With the lightning-like
movement of a frightened deer, she darted
forward. Seeing a door knob, she grasped it.
The door opened. Before her was a steel ladder.
She was fifty feet up that ladder before
she took time to think.</p>
<p>At that instant the door closed. She was in
profound darkness. Only far above her shone
pale light, a small square of night sky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>Her heart was racing furiously. Why had
she indulged in such madness? That great
dome of the Transportation Building was
thronged with people. Any one of these would
have offered her protection.</p>
<p>Now here she was in a narrow place of darkness.
The door was closed. Had it shut itself?
Had the long-eared Chinaman entered to close
it behind him?</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has the three-bladed knife!&rdquo; she
thought with a shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The three-bladed knife is not for to kill.&rdquo;
The mandarin&rsquo;s words came back to her. Scant
comfort in this. It was sharp enough to kill
if the Oriental&rsquo;s purpose was murder.</p>
<p>She was at the parting of the ways. Above
her, a hundred and twenty-five feet from the
ground, up that narrow ladder, was the top
of the dome. Beneath her, fifty feet down,
the good earth and the man she feared.</p>
<p>All this passed through her mind in ten seconds
of time. Then, without having truly
willed it, she began to climb.</p>
<p>Never before had she climbed so high on a
ladder. Now to go higher and higher, feeling
her way every step in the dark, thinking of
the dizzy depths below, was agony.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>But what else was there to be done? All
her life she had been frightened by the mysterious
silence of Orientals. They moved about
with padded footsteps. Their voices were low.
She seldom heard them speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man may be coming,&rdquo; she told herself,
&ldquo;climbing like a cat&mdash;silently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up, up she went. The square of light appeared
to grow, to come closer and closer until
with a sigh that was half a sob, she tumbled
over its brink to fall upon the cold metallic
surface of the dome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, having thought of the Chinaman, she
seized a trap door, slammed it shut, and sat
down upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might be able to lift me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her keen eyes sought and found a bolt that
could be drawn. It would fasten down the trap
door. She shot the bolt into place.</p>
<p>Then, experiencing an overwhelming sense
of relief, she sprang to her feet and, whirling
into an intoxicating rhythm, went dancing
across that vast dome.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>For the moment she was safe, she was free.
Petite Jeanne did not bother too much about
the future.</p>
<p>Dancing away to the very crest of the dome,
which was not a dome as we think of it, but a
vast inverted saucer two hundred feet in diameter,
she spread her arms wide and stood
there poised like some white bird ready for
flight.</p>
<p>The scene that lay spread out far beneath
her was entrancing. To her right, by the lagoon&rsquo;s
bank, blazed the camp fire of the African
village. Farther away were the tepees of
the red men. Close at hand all manner of
lights were blinking, racing, plunging, dancing.
These were the wild thrill-producing features
of the Midway. Here a vast building
lifted a blue tower to the sky. Far away the
rocket cars of the Sky Ride shot through
space.</p>
<p>For a time Jeanne thought only of that
which lay beneath her eye. At last her gaze
wandered to the cool of Lake Michigan&rsquo;s vast
waters by night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>And then her thoughts returned to that
great circle of steel upon which she stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a beam support, not a post nor a girder.
It is suspended in air. Great steel cables
hold it in place. Cut those steel cables, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shuddered at the thought. And yet,
what a marvel it all was!</p>
<p>Then of a sudden she recalled her appointment
at the Rutledge Tavern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence said I was to meet a movie queen.
There was something in her tone that tells me
an exciting time is to be had, and here&mdash;here
I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly her mind sobered. She was alone
on this broad dome. Should she scream for
help the sound of her voice would be lost in
the roar of the merry-mad throng. From the
Midway came the grind of a merry-go-round.
Somewhere much farther away a band was
dispensing glorious music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must get down. The ladder is the only
way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>She shuddered. Coming up, straight up a
hundred and twenty-five feet, had been nerve-wracking.
What must a descent into that
black hole be?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that terrible Chinaman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, perhaps, after all, he had not followed.</p>
<p>Then a thought struck her. What if some
guard had seen her mount that ladder? She
would surely be arrested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got to do it!&rdquo; She set her teeth
hard. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find out about the long-eared one;
lift the trap door quick. If he&rsquo;s there I&rsquo;ll slam
it down again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if he&rsquo;s not there, I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got to go
down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catching a quick breath and whispering:
&ldquo;<i>Now!</i>&rdquo; she lifted the trap door.</p>
<p>She did not drop it. There was no one at
the top of the ladder.</p>
<p>Who can say that it did not take courage to
drag her feet off the top of the dome and allow
them to dangle until they came into contact
with a round of the ladder? Who can tell how
many miles it seemed to the bottom?</p>
<p>Enough that she reached solid earth at last.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>Then, catching her breath for the second
time, she seized the knob, turned it, swung the
door open, stepped out, closed it silently,
glanced to the right and to the left, then
dashed for the cool outer air of night&mdash;free!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br />JEANNE&rsquo;S DOUBLE</h2>
<p>On reaching the Tavern Jeanne found herself
in a high state of agitation. The
hour was late. How late? This she could not
tell. Had she missed her appointment? Would
the movie queen be gone? She caught her
breath at the thought. Something had told
her that this meeting meant an open door, one
more great opportunity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she breathed as, dropping into a
chair, she looked at the clock. &ldquo;It lacks ten
minutes of the hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes roved the room. &ldquo;They are not
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tea,&rdquo; she said to the waitress, &ldquo;very black
tea, one large pot of tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that experience in the great dome she
felt in need of this mild stimulant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>She was in a state of mellow glow imparted
by the tea, when Florence ushered into the
now all but empty room a person who on the
instant brought a gasp from Jeanne&rsquo;s pink
lips.</p>
<p>For a full moment Jeanne and the stranger
stared at one another in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo; said Jeanne at last, &ldquo;must be I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the other quite positively, &ldquo;it is
you who are to be some one else. You are to
be Lorena LeMar. That is what we are here
to talk about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waiter,&rdquo; she ordered, &ldquo;bring us coffee,
very black.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One demi-tasse,&rdquo; Jeanne murmured.</p>
<p>It was only after the golden-haired movie
star had drained the last drop of her coffee
piping hot, that she turned to Jeanne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you-all draw your chairs up to the
fire?&rdquo; It was Jensie Crider, the rosy-cheeked
mountain girl, who stood beside them. &ldquo;You
see everyone is gone. There is a cool breeze
from the lake. The fire is so cheerful!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, let us do that!&rdquo; Jeanne exclaimed
quickly, touched by the girl&rsquo;s simple kindness.
&ldquo;Yes, we shall do that, and you, my dear, shall
sit with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this&mdash;&rdquo; Miss LeMar&rsquo;s tone suggested
caution. &ldquo;This is to be something of a secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; Jeanne said in a sharp whisper,
&ldquo;does not matter. In the mountains secrets
are kept as nowhere else in the world. Jensie
is from the mountains. It is not so?&rdquo; She
turned to Jensie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It most certainly is true,&rdquo; Jensie agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well then&mdash;&rdquo; Lorena LeMar moved toward
the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she threw out a petulant hand
as they gathered about the fire, &ldquo;I am on the
lot over there in what they call &lsquo;Little Hollywood.&rsquo;
Five days from now I am to begin a
picture&mdash;you know, show the people how it&rsquo;s
done. There are seats for thousands out there,
and all that. Bah! I don&rsquo;t like seats. And I
hate people about, when I am making a picture!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But people, an audience!&rdquo; Jeanne murmured,
&ldquo;That is wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Glad you like it. Not for me!&rdquo; Miss LeMar
tossed her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;comes the opportunity
of a lifetime. My opportunity. Rodney
McBride, one of the richest men in Chicago,
is making up a yachting party to go north.
Think of it! A yacht a hundred and forty feet
long! Singing, dancing, drinking! Oh, yi! yi!
Moonlit waters. Mackinac Island, the Soo
Canal, Isle Royale in Lake Superior, speed
boats, sailboats and all that!&rdquo; She sprang to
her feet in a gesture of great impatience.
&ldquo;Think of giving up all that just to work out
there on the lot with five thousand people staring
at you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But think of having your name on the electric
signs all over the country!&rdquo; Jeanne murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nix!&rdquo; Miss LeMar stamped her foot.
&ldquo;When it&rsquo;s all over the thing&rsquo;s sure to be
scrapped. The picture&rsquo;s too big for the lot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve shot some fine little stories out
there, short ones; but not this. No! No!&rdquo;
Again she stamped her foot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought&mdash;&rdquo; Her tone changed as she
dropped into a chair. &ldquo;I thought that since
you are my double, so perfectly, and since
you&rsquo;d been in light opera, you might&mdash;&rdquo; she
cleared her throat&mdash;&ldquo;you might be willing to
take my place on&mdash;on the lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As Lorena LeMar?&rdquo; Jeanne stared at her
in unbelief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As Lorena LeMar. It wouldn&rsquo;t be hard,
really.&rdquo; The movie star&rsquo;s tone was eager. &ldquo;All
you&rsquo;d have to do would be to study the script,
get the continuity and the lines, then just go
on and&mdash;and do your bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And really,&rdquo; she half apologized, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not
as if the thing would ever get across. It never
will. One of those natural things, not spicy
at all&mdash;don&rsquo;t you know? And besides, there&rsquo;s
the lot&mdash;it&rsquo;s too small. It could only be done
properly in Hollywood, really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne looked at Florence. Florence was
gazing at the fire. Jeanne knew what that
meant. Florence was saying to herself: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
off again! First it was light opera, then grand
opera; now it&rsquo;s to be the movies.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s tone was little more
than a whisper, &ldquo;the story of this movie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The story,&rdquo; Miss LeMar said lightly,
&ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t amount to much. As I&rsquo;ve told you, it
may never get as far as a preview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must know,&rdquo; Jeanne murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s just one of those mountain things.&rdquo;
Miss LeMar&rsquo;s tone was light. &ldquo;The side of
Big Black Mountain; that&rsquo;s the place, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big Black Mountain!&rdquo; Jensie, who had listened
quietly until now, exclaimed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
my home!&rdquo; Her cheek turned crimson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And down there somewhere Lincoln was
born!&rdquo; said Jeanne. There was a touch of reverence
in her tone.</p>
<p>All this was lost on Lorena LeMar. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
love story, of course,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;Boy and
girl standing on the side of a mountain.
Springtime. Trees in bloom. Apple trees, I
guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dogwood,&rdquo; Jensie corrected. She was leaning
forward eagerly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway, there&rsquo;s the girl, about sixteen,
and a boy about eighteen. Lovers. Boy&rsquo;s
going away. They&rsquo;re saying good-bye. No
clinches. Too bashful for that. Just a touch
of the hand. Girl throws her apron over her
eyes after he&rsquo;s gone&mdash;that sort of thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl&mdash;her name&rsquo;s Zola Setser&mdash;hears
some one singing. She listens. She looks.
A donkey appears around the rough path. An
Italian, with big brown eyes and all that, rides
the donkey bareback. He is singing &lsquo;O Sole
Mio.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She listens and watches. A horse comes
into view. A downcast sort of woman is riding
the horse; two ragged children are hanging
on behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of a sudden there comes the clatter of
hoofs and a fat youth, dressed to kill, all leggings,
silver spurs, you know, comes dashing
along on a blooded horse. He bumps into the
woman, knocks the children off the horse,
bumps into the Italian and sends him sprawling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Damn poor white trash!&rsquo; the fat youth
swears, as he leaps from his saddle. &lsquo;Damn
Dago!&rsquo;&rdquo; Miss LeMar waved her hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The mountain girl&rsquo;s dog,&rdquo; Lorena LeMar&rsquo;s
voice went on, &ldquo;a long-eared sort of hound,
comes out barking. The fat youth gives the
poor hound a kick that sends him away with a
wild howl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he puts on a grand air, and favors
the beautiful Zola with a flattering smile while
he asks the way to Pounding Mill Creek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zola tells him the way. But you can see
she&rsquo;d much rather shoot him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Damn poor white trash!&rsquo; the Italian repeats,
picking himself up from the dust after
the fat youth has ridden on. &lsquo;Damn Dago!&rsquo;
Everybody like us, eh? Ha! Getta &rsquo;long fine.
I gotta ten dolla&rsquo;, gotta one donkey. What
say we start a coal mine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zola laughs at the joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Italian is serious. He makes good
his word and starts a mine. Zola&rsquo;s father owns
some rough land full of coal. He and this
Italian, Tony Riccordio, join as partners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; Miss LeMar yawned, &ldquo;is what
you might call the first act.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine beginning,&rdquo; Florence enthused.
&ldquo;And I suppose the mine prospers. Zola marries
the dark-eyed Italian, and they live happily
ever after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, you&rsquo;re wrong. That&rsquo;s too simple.&rdquo;
Lorena LeMar took a fresh start. &ldquo;They mine
coal and ship it. The fat youth from the outside,
who is supposed to be rich, mines coal
and ships it too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is intrigue in Louisville. Tony
Riccordio has his coal held on the rails. Costs
pile up. He is about to go into bankruptcy and
Zola&rsquo;s papa with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Zola hides in a load of soft coal and
rides to Louisville. The switchmen dig her out
and wash her up. When they see what a swell
looker she is, they swear allegiance to her
cause, and the day is won.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zola goes back. There is a dance. Mountmorris
Mortimer, the fat youth, insults Zola.
Tony throws him over a cliff&mdash;not a very high
cliff. Only two ribs are broken. They ship
him out in a freight car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It turns out that Mountmorris has lost all
his money. His mine closes. Tony gets rich&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And he marries&mdash;&rdquo; Jeanne put a hand over
Florence&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Miss LeMar smiled, &ldquo;the handsome
mountain boy Zola was telling good-bye in the
beginning comes back. He and Zola go into a
clinch. Tony adds his blessing, sells his share
in the mine, stuffs his pockets with money and
goes riding back over the mountains, singing
&lsquo;O Sole Mio&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; Miss LeMar added with a drawl,
&ldquo;is the drift of the story. Of course there&rsquo;s a
lot more to it. But you can see. What do you
say? Is it a go? I&rsquo;ll see that you get five hundred
dollars a week. Two full weeks if you&rsquo;ll
only do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five hundred dollars for just one week!&rdquo;
It was Jensie, the little mountain girl who
spoke in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, dearie,&rdquo; Lorena LeMar favored her
with a smile, &ldquo;is nothing, just nothing at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she half apologised to Jeanne.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all I can spare just now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&mdash;it&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo; One could see plainly
enough that Jeanne was not thinking of
the money at all, but of the strange circumstances
that had brought this unusual opportunity
to her door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To <i>be</i> some one else for two whole weeks,&rdquo;
she was saying to herself. &ldquo;To forget that
Petite Jeanne lives at all. To act in the movies
when one has never crossed a movie lot before.
It seems quite impossible. And yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds like a beautiful story,&rdquo; she murmured
after a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> beautiful!&rdquo; Jensie exclaimed. &ldquo;But
they could make it so much more beautiful if
they only knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knew what?&rdquo; Miss LeMar opened her eyes
wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knew the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&mdash;&rdquo; The movie star&rsquo;s voice was
low, almost sad. There was about the little
mountain girl an all but irresistible appeal.
&ldquo;That does not matter. It&rsquo;s only an exhibition.
It&rsquo;ll never go on the screen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could be made very beautiful,&rdquo; Jeanne
repeated musingly. Then suddenly a new
light sprang into her eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; Miss LeMar leaped to her
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have to see a great deal of you in
the next few days,&rdquo; Jeanne insisted. &ldquo;I must
copy your character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See me all you like, so long as I can get
off on that yacht cruise. Good-night. I&rsquo;ll be
seeing you.&rdquo; The great movie star, Lorena
LeMar, was away, leaving in her wake surprise,
anticipation, eager hope and blank despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did I say &lsquo;yes&rsquo;?&rdquo; Jeanne murmured
at last. &ldquo;Who in the world could ever do
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one person,&rdquo; Florence smiled. &ldquo;And
her name is Petite Jeanne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But could she?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br />&ldquo;HAUNTS&rdquo;</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Does she mean that you can <i>really</i> act
in the movies?&rdquo; Jensie Crider&rsquo;s eyes
were big with wonder as she ventured this
question. They were still seated by the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She undoubtedly thinks that.&rdquo; Springing
to her feet, the little French girl walked the
length of the long room and back again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it <i>is</i> too bad it is not to be a real picture.&rdquo;
There was genuine sadness in the little
mountain girl&rsquo;s tone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen some mountain
pictures. They are so, so terrible! And
they could be so beautiful!</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the dogwood is in bloom,&rdquo; she murmured
softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jensie!&rdquo; Jeanne cried, seizing her by the
shoulders and looking far back into her deep,
mysterious eyes. &ldquo;If I tried to make that a
real picture, would you help me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;d do my double-durndest!&rdquo; Jensie
laughed in spite of herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Jensie.&rdquo; Jeanne was like a spring
day. Sunshine and joy came one moment. The
next there were clouds and rain. &ldquo;All right,
little girl.&rdquo; Her shoulders drooped. &ldquo;We&mdash;we
might try it. You never can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dropped into a chair before the fire.</p>
<p>Jensie went about the humble task of scrubbing
the floor. Florence insisted upon helping
her, so together, on hands and knees, they
made their way back and forth, back and forth
across the large room.</p>
<p>All this time Jeanne sat in deep thought.
Once she murmured to herself, &ldquo;It was before
the fire in Rutledge Tavern that the great one,
Abraham Lincoln, who with all his greatness
was so simple and kind, sat for long hours
dreaming of the future, reading his fortune in
the flames, reading it to a girl, Ann Rutledge
who, as simple and kind as he, understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then&mdash;&rdquo; She stared hard at the fire.
&ldquo;Then the girl was gone forever, and he had
to go on alone, all the way alone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He was an American, this great Lincoln,
and I am only a poor little French girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But perhaps&mdash;&rdquo; She stared once more at
the flames of orange and gold. &ldquo;Perhaps I
might make people understand and love him
more if I could give them a true picture of the
mountain country where he was born.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the dogwood is in bloom,&rdquo; she whispered.
Her voice was deep and mellow, like a
night bird&rsquo;s call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Jeanne! Snap out of it!&rdquo; Florence
was at her side. &ldquo;The floor is done.
We&rsquo;re going to have hot chocolate and some
of those cake squares they call brownies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again Jeanne marched across the floor
to the back of the room. As she turned, her
gaze strayed through the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hearse,&rdquo; she whispered with a shudder.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still waiting in the moonlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having turned quickly about to shut out the
scene, she found herself looking at a tall-backed
organ standing against the wall. The
moonlight falling across its ivory keys, yellow
with age, gave it a ghostly appearance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Boo! Spooky place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was glad enough to retreat to the narrow
circle made by the fire&rsquo;s yellow glow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the dogwood is in bloom,&rdquo; she whispered
a moment later. With the light of the
fire in her eyes, she forgot all else save those
far away mountains.</p>
<p>She called back from memory&rsquo;s hidden
places one springtime when, with Bihari the
gypsy and his good wife, she had stolen away
to the mountains of France in a gypsy van.
They had gone to meet the loitering spring.</p>
<p>They had found her lingering among the
hills. There tiny flowers were blooming gaily.
There, too, they had caught the white drift of
blossoming trees.</p>
<p>Never in all her wanderings had Jeanne
found such simple and kindly people as those
who had hewn their homes from the forests on
these hills.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>When nights were damp and chill they had
invited her to sit beside their rough stone fireplaces.
At night they had tucked her away in
a corner and piled her high with blankets and
coverlids woven in fantastic patterns, all
woven by hand.</p>
<p>When Bihari had mended their pots and
pans, when they were ready to journey onward,
they had crowded round to press her
hand and add as a blessing an invitation to
return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And these mountains where our Jensie
lives,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;They are like that.
They must be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; she breathed, &ldquo;it must be truly
wonderful when the dogwood is in bloom on
Big Black Mountain. Jensie shall tell me all
about it. Then, who knows? If only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dreaming still,&rdquo; Florence broke in. &ldquo;Come!
The hot chocolate and cakes are ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this late hour of refreshment, which
was indeed a time of glorious fellowship, a
thing happened which will linger long in their
memories.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was in this Tavern,&rdquo; Jeanne was saying,
&ldquo;that Abe Lincoln and Ann Rutledge sang
those strange religious songs that people of
those times loved so well. I read some of them
only yesterday. Listen! This is one of them:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Death like an overflowing stream</p>
<p class="t0">Sweeps us away. Our life&rsquo;s a dream,</p>
<p class="t0">An empty tale, a morning flower</p>
<p class="t0">Cut down and withered in an hour.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>There was silence down that long, dark
room, where only the dull glow of coals cast
an uncertain light about the narrow semicircle.
Jeanne&rsquo;s soul was like a deep pool; it reflected
all that came before it. Deeply moved by the
strange sad words of other days, she could
move her listeners.</p>
<p>Presently her mellow voice rose again:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Teach me the measure of my days,</p>
<p class="t0">Thou Maker of my frame.</p>
<p class="t0">I would survey life&rsquo;s narrow space</p>
<p class="t0">And learn how frail I am.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Such songs as these,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Is it
not very strange?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the little mountain girl replied,
catching the spirit of the moment. &ldquo;And sometimes
Ann Rutledge sat before that tall old
reed organ and played while they sang together.
They&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Jeanne held up a hand. Out from
the silence of that long room came the <i>Dong!
Dong!</i> of the ancient clock striking the hour.
&ldquo;This&mdash;&rdquo; Her tone was deep and low. &ldquo;This
is my hour of enchantment. This&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who knows what she was about to say?
She broke off to sit listening, stiff with sudden
emotion. From the far corner where the
darkness reigned came the strange, church-like
notes of a reed organ.</p>
<p>The melody that came rolling back to them
was strange, a wild, weird something, perhaps
from the past&mdash;a forgotten song no living
mortal had ever heard.</p>
<p>It continued for a full five minutes. And in
all that time not one of them moved or spoke.</p>
<p>When the last note died away, the stout
Florence found her courage returning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to see.&rdquo; Her voice reached them in a
low whisper.</p>
<p>Dropping on hands and knees, she disappeared
into the dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;who can it be?&rdquo; Jeanne whispered
to Jensie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is no one.&rdquo; Jensie&rsquo;s words were
scarcely audible.</p>
<p>After that they sat in silence until with a
start Jeanne felt a hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; She sprang to her feet.</p>
<p>Florence stood beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;who was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The look on Florence&rsquo;s face was strange.
&ldquo;There was no one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you?&rdquo; Jensie reminded Jeanne.
&ldquo;I told you there was no one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haunts,&rdquo; Jensie explained quite simply.
&ldquo;We have haunts in the mountains. There
are good haunts and bad haunts. I think this
was a good haunt. Ann Rutledge was good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, without a word, they filed out of
the place in silence, locked the door behind
them, then hurried away into the night.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>For a long time that night after Florence
had retired, Jeanne sat by the open window,
thinking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>Far away she caught the black sweep of
Lake Michigan&rsquo;s waters, where dim, indistinct,
a single ship&rsquo;s light gleamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a strange and wonderful world!&rdquo; she
told herself. &ldquo;Sometimes quite terrible, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more she allowed her mind to drift
over the events of the past few days. She saw
it all as in a dream: the auction house, the
mysterious chest, the fire on the beach, and
the Chinaman fleeing into the night with the
three-bladed knife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence will never rest until she has found
him and has that precious knife back,&rdquo; she
told herself. &ldquo;But will she find him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again in her imagination she saw their
room in wild confusion&mdash;saw, too, the empty
chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never told Florence about&mdash;about that
laundry bag I left with the check boy at the
hotel. I wonder if I should? And should I
leave it there any longer? The mandarin said
they were worth many, many dollars, those
ancient pieces of embroidery work all done in
threads of silver and gold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah well, the place to hide things is where
no one will expect to find them. And as for
Florence, the things you do not seem to possess
are the ones that trouble you least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she sat wriggling her pink toes and
staring away at that one yellow light far out
upon the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this moving picture!&rdquo; she exclaimed
at last. &ldquo;Why did I say &lsquo;yes&rsquo;? How can I be
some one else for even two short weeks?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then&mdash;&rdquo; Her face took on a rapt expression.
&ldquo;If one could but make a success of
that picture when every one believes it is to be
a failure. Ah, that would be marvelous! So
very, very superb!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaping to her feet, she danced across the
floor and at last tucked herself into her bed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X</span>
<br />ENTERING A NEW WORLD</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, when I sail away on that
glorious yachting party, you&rsquo;ll come
here to live.&rdquo; That Lorena LeMar, Jeanne&rsquo;s
double, spoke in a matter-of-fact tone made
no difference. Jeanne&rsquo;s heart fluttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; she managed to gasp as her eyes
swept the spacious hotel apartment with its
glimmer of silver and gold, silk and satin.
&ldquo;Here? I couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you must!&rdquo; In Lorena LeMar&rsquo;s
tone there was a note of finality. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t
well live anywhere else. This is the apartment
of Lorena LeMar. Every one knows that.
This is my address. They call me on the phone
here, my company, my friends, my&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your friends!&rdquo; Jeanne gasped afresh. &ldquo;Am
I to be Lorena LeMar to your friends also?
How&mdash;how very impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>Jeanne&rsquo;s head was in a wild whirl. For three
days she had haunted the steps of her double,
Lorena LeMar. They had been obliged to
show great caution. Never had they been
where others might see them together. This
would have proved fatal to their plans. Nevertheless
in out-of-the-way places and in this,
Lorena LeMar&rsquo;s apartment, Jeanne had been
privileged to study her famous double until,
as she expressed it to Florence, &ldquo;already I am
no more Petite Jeanne, but altogether Lorena
LeMar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never until this moment had it occurred to
her that if she were to carry off her part she
must abandon the shabby comfort of her
rooms with Florence and come here to live,
nor that Lorena LeMar&rsquo;s friends must for two
weeks be her friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does Lorena LeMar live?&rdquo; she asked
herself with a sinking heart. &ldquo;And what do
those friends expect of her?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>Little need to ask. Already she knew all too
well. Lorena LeMar was an American, city-bred
girl, no better and no worse than the
average. Slender, vivacious, frank, quite lovable,
she lived as those others live. There were
dances, late parties, jazz and everything that
went with it. Jeanne knew very little of this
type of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your&mdash;your friends&mdash;&rdquo; she stammered
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, as to that&mdash;&rdquo; Lorena LeMar
shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;Shake &rsquo;em, every
one of them. Tell them that Lorena LeMar,
meaning you, is doing a picture, a vastly important
picture, going to make you famous
and all that. Tell &rsquo;em you are in mourning or
something like that, no parties, no nothing
until this picture is made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I see,&rdquo; Jeanne replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; she thought aside, &ldquo;is perhaps
more true than you think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again her gaze swept the room. Could
she do it, live like an American queen for two
weeks?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>Costly paintings were on the walls, the sort
she loved. Inch-deep Oriental rugs were on
the floor. Against the broad wall was a great
friendly hearth where a real wood fire burned.
Heavy draperies were everywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those Oriental embroideries, threads of
silver and gold,&rdquo; she thought suddenly. &ldquo;How
they would fit in here!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no! No! It must never be! I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll step in here for a moment,&rdquo; the
movie queen threw open a door, &ldquo;I will show
you my wardrobe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather poor,&rdquo; she apologised. &ldquo;Some
good things, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne found herself in a sleeping chamber.
The opening of a second door revealed row
upon row of coats and gowns. Here squirrel,
mink and ermine vied with silk and satin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;Oo, la la!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; once again Lorena LeMar&rsquo;s
tone was matter-of-fact, &ldquo;while you are Lorena
LeMar you will wear these. Nothing will
go so far toward perfecting your disguise.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>This time Jeanne had no word to offer. She
was trying in vain to picture herself, Petite
Jeanne&mdash;the little French girl who for many
months had traveled with gypsies, dancing
with a bear&mdash;living in this apartment and
wearing these clothes.</p>
<p>It was true that for the better part of a
year she had been considered rich. But, in
France, to be rich is to be thrifty. Her people
were all that. She had fallen into their way
of thinking. Few garments had been added to
her wardrobe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now this!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Ah, well, I
am to be a queen, a queen of the movies for
two weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went skipping away across the floor in
one of her wild gypsy dances.</p>
<p>Lorena LeMar caught her in her arms as
she came dancing back. &ldquo;Then you will do it?
You dearest of all creatures!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I resist it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>And yet, left alone in the midst of all this
splendor while her double went on a shopping
tour to secure sports clothes for her yachting
trip, the little French girl was all but overcome
with misgivings. It is one thing to appear
on a movie lot each day and say certain
words, go through certain gestures that have
been learned and rehearsed; but quite another
to live as your double has lived, among acquaintances,
associates, friends off stage, from
morning till night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall become a bookworm,&rdquo; she assured
herself. &ldquo;When I am not rehearsing or playing
a part I shall be right here curled up reading
a book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But could she? Would Lorena LeMar&rsquo;s
friends permit it? What did those friends expect?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, time will tell,&rdquo; she sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And besides, there is that so beautiful
story, the movie story of mountain life, life of
Lincoln&rsquo;s own country, where he was born.
One cannot forget, one must not forget!</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the dogwood is in bloom,&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;If only I can do it! If only I can!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; she consoled herself, &ldquo;Lorena
LeMar belongs in California. All her friends
are there, or nearly all. They must be.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>That she was mistaken in this, she was to
know, and that almost at once. As she left the
hotel elevator on the way home, a hand
touched her arm. She turned about to find herself
looking into a pair of smiling eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Jerry,&rdquo; the boy was saying. &ldquo;You remember
me, don&rsquo;t you, Miss LeMar? Could
I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a second Jeanne&rsquo;s head spun, then she
found her senses and her ready French tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Jerry! No dates! I&rsquo;m out on the
lot, doing a picture, you know. It&mdash;it&rsquo;s dreadfully
important. Sorry, Jerry. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There now,&rdquo; she whispered to herself as
she leaped into a taxi, &ldquo;I got away with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For all that, a sinking feeling lurked around
the pit of her stomach. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; she was thinking,
quite against her will, &ldquo;is but the beginning.
Miss LeMar has many friends and more
admirers. Not all of these will be as smiling
and as kind as this Jerry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; she reassured herself, &ldquo;Florence
shall be my bodyguard. She&rsquo;ll throw them
from the window.&rdquo; She smiled a merry smile.</p>
<p>But Florence was working. Long hours every
day she was on the Enchanted Island. And
just there came the blow to Jeanne&rsquo;s plans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br />FROM CHINA&rsquo;S ANCIENT TREASURE</h2>
<p>While Jeanne was making the rather
disturbing discovery that when you
take over a double&rsquo;s labors you take over her
friends as well, Florence was listening to
words that, now thrilling her to the very
depths of her soul, and now slowing up her
heart until her very blood ran cold, left her
at last full of half-formed hopes and well established
fears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>Every afternoon from four o&rsquo;clock to six,
she was given a rest from her duties on the
Enchanted Island. During these periods of
leisure she wandered through the grounds.
The wonders of science and invention that
were spread out before her never failed to hold
her interest. For all this, she took pleasure at
times in visiting the more bizarre attractions.
To watch the Seminole Indians dive beneath
a great alligator with his snapping jaws and
thrashing tail, to watch the little brown man&rsquo;s
conquest of the scaly monster, gave her a
thrill. To study the quaint customs of men
from the heart of Africa; to don a bathing suit
and take a long, long slide into the blue waters,
all these things held a charm for this sturdy,
adventure-loving girl.</p>
<p>This day she had entered the Golden Temple
of Jehol to study its varied treasures from
the heart of China. These things charmed and
fascinated her.</p>
<p>The place was crowded. With such a throng
pushing through its narrow aisles, the temple
had lost much of its charm. She was about to
wander once more into the open air, when her
attention was caught and held by a face.</p>
<p>To her own astonishment, she stood there
and stared at the man until he turned and
smiled at her. Then she felt ashamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want a book?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>It was the white man who had been born
in China and had lived all his life there; the
one who had so held Jeanne&rsquo;s attention and
had all but drawn from her the secret of the
three-bladed dagger and the chest of Oriental
embroideries. Surely here was some one it
was hard to overlook. The tone in which he
spoke was matter-of-fact. Yet a strange light
shone from his eyes.</p>
<p>There are meetings that appear to have
been ordered by some power outside ourselves.
The instant the thing has happened we know
it. With a simple flash of an eye one soul says
to the other: &ldquo;We are kindred spirits. We
were born to be friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&mdash;where did all this come from?&rdquo;
she asked rather breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this stuff, the idols, the trumpets, the
tapestries?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From China. Much of it from far back in
the interior, even in Mongolia. I&mdash;I had a
hand in gathering it. All came from temples,
ancient temples&mdash;hard to get at times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man, who was quite young, spoke with
a curious accent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not American?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I belong to China.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are not Chinese,&rdquo; she laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Mongolian; but if you are born in
China, live there always, what are you then?&rdquo;
He showed his fine white teeth in a grin.</p>
<p>Looking her up and down, taking in her
costume that told she was &ldquo;one of them,&rdquo; he
said in a tone quite low and aside:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be free in half an hour. What about
a cup of coffee? I&rsquo;ll tell you about these
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All&mdash;all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she wandered out into the sunlight,
something told her she had started one more
friendship that would end in adventure. What
she did not know was that she was about to be
given one more chapter in the history of the
mysterious Oriental chest and its temple treasures.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>An hour after leaving the temple, she found
herself seated at a narrow table in a dark
little corner of a nearby coffee house, drinking
black coffee and following every word of
this most astonishing young man. His name,
she had discovered, was Erik Nord. He had
lived all his life in China and, as he expressed
it, had &ldquo;adventured all over the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d gone into Mongolia, that cold, barren
land where no one is wanted,&rdquo; he was saying.
&ldquo;The man I was with&mdash;I shall not tell you his
name&mdash;had been commissioned to gather up
a lot of this art treasure that is so rapidly disappearing
from the decaying temples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a long-eared Chinaman who
came near doing me in! Big knife and all
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;a long-eared Chinaman!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Longest ears I ever saw. Looked as if some
plastic surgeon had spliced pieces on from
some other fellow&rsquo;s ears&mdash;might have, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happened like this,&rdquo; he went on, taking
no notice of her stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d picked up some things, jolly unusual
they were, too; gold and silver embroidery,
rare old stuff, a bell and a knife&mdash;three-bladed
affair&mdash;some rare old pieces of embroidery&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A knife!&rdquo; Florence was staring again.
&ldquo;Three-bladed!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But of course,&rdquo; she added hurriedly, &ldquo;they
are common, I suppose. There is one over in
the temple, isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must not betray secrets,&rdquo; she was saying
to herself. &ldquo;Not to a man I have known for
only an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one was not common,&rdquo; Erik Nord said
quietly. &ldquo;The hilt was all studded with jewels,
diamonds and rubies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again Florence opened her mouth to
speak, then thought better of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found these things,&rdquo; Erik Nord went
on, after a moment, &ldquo;in a rather extraordinary
manner. It seems some American, a curious
sort of fellow, but very real in his devotion to
these people, had somehow talked the whole
little city out of their temple worship. He&rsquo;d
turned the temple into a hospital for children,
Chinese children.&rdquo; His voice trailed off into
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever see any?&rdquo; he asked a moment later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;See what?&rdquo; Florence asked, startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon. Ever see any Chinese children?
No, of course not. Well, they&rsquo;re the
cutest ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drawing a thin metal case from his pocket,
he shook a handful of cards from it, then
spread them out on the table.</p>
<p>Florence stared in astonishment. Each card
was a photograph, the picture of a Chinese
child. Children asleep, children crying, laughing,
romping. In their quaint costumes they
were indeed fascinating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little children.&rdquo; His voice dropped to a
husky whisper. &ldquo;The hospital was for them.
The people had agreed that all the treasures
of the temple should be sold and the money
spent in equipping their hospital for children,
the quaint little children of China.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; his voice changed abruptly,
&ldquo;the treasures were all lost. I fear the money
may never be paid. And it was entirely my
own fault! Can you imagine what that means
to me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>Florence did not answer. She was thinking
hard. And in her thoughts the mental image
of a long-eared Chinaman was blended with
flashes of a three-bladed knife and the pictures
of a host of cute Chinese children.</p>
<p>When at last she broke the silence she was
surprised to find that her voice, too, had taken
on a suspicious hoarseness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you said there was a long-eared
Chinaman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that long-eared fellow. It&mdash;it was
queer.&rdquo; He took a long pull at his black coffee.
&ldquo;He looked like some sort of monk, or
priest. A Buddhist, I mean. He nearly got the
chest of treasure from us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, it was entrusted to our care. It
was sold all right, but wouldn&rsquo;t be paid for
until delivered to the purchaser in America.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He tried to knife the man I was with, this
long-eared fellow did. Entered our tent at
night. Fortunately, I was awake. I smashed
him one just in time; nearly killed him.
Thought I had, until he showed up in Tientsin
and made a second attempt to rob us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But the treasure?&rdquo; Florence tried to still
her wildly beating heart, to seem calm, unconcerned.
&ldquo;The treasure? What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the question!&rdquo; Erik Nord
shrugged his broad shoulders. &ldquo;It was entrusted
to me. I sent the chest that contained
it all&mdash;worth a lot of dollars I can tell you&mdash;to
San Francisco in care of a friend. It arrived
in due time. The friend paid the duty
and re-shipped it to Chicago. As far as I know,
it never arrived.&rdquo; He sat back and stared at
the ceiling. &ldquo;I trusted the wrong man. He
bungled it somehow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he added in a whisper, &ldquo;is one of
the reasons I&rsquo;m here. Somehow that long-eared
Chinaman has beaten us. We&rsquo;ve got to
catch up with him. In time we&rsquo;ll get him, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence did not finish. What should she
tell? All or nothing?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Might not be the man,&rdquo; she assured herself.
&ldquo;Might not have been the same chest.
Anyway, the chest is all I have left. That&rsquo;s
worthless. What&rsquo;s the good of getting mixed
up in an Oriental intrigue? Anyway, I&rsquo;ll talk
it over with Jeanne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus her mind ran, and all this time Erik
Nord was studying her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man,&rdquo; she finished rather lamely,
&ldquo;must have been clever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clever no end!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, time to wander back.&rdquo; He rose. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
been a pleasure to be with you. I&rsquo;d like to
know about America, the best of America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I belong to the best?&rdquo; she
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem rather real.&rdquo; His smile was
frank. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like all this face-paint and jazz,
pretty girls smoking cigarets, and all that.
Well, I&rsquo;m old-fashioned, I suppose. In China
we put paint on the temples and burn incense
in ancient copper dragons, not between young
ladies&rsquo; lips.&rdquo; He laughed good-naturedly, then
ushered her into the twilight of the passing
day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br />THE DODGE-EMS</h2>
<p>&ldquo;They say,&rdquo; Florence murmured to herself,
as she left the Enchanted Island
that night, &ldquo;that murderers always return to
the scene of their crimes. That long-eared
Chinaman did not commit murder when he
took that sky-walk of his, but if he didn&rsquo;t commit
suicide he may be back. Perhaps the Sky
Ride holds for him some strange fascination.
I wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was still wondering when her feet had
led her to the foot of the east tower of that
spectacular Sky Way. She waited for an up-going
car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to get him,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;I
must!&rdquo; A fierce determination took possession
of her. Erik Nord&rsquo;s story had embedded itself
deeply in her soul.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Children.&rdquo; She smiled as she recalled the
pictures of cute Chinese youngsters he had
shown her. &ldquo;And to think that they should
be robbed of hospital care by one selfish Chinaman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the elevator door opened. She
stepped inside to go whirling upward. She did
not cease to ponder. &ldquo;Is this long-eared Chinaman
merely selfish? Is he greedy for wealth?&rdquo;
There had been a rather startling look of
fierce determination on his face. &ldquo;Superstitious,&rdquo;
she whispered. &ldquo;All Orientals are that,
I suppose. There must be something about
that knife, the bell and the banners that we
don&rsquo;t know about. He would risk his life for
them, I am sure of that. Commit murder, too!&rdquo;
She shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo; A sudden thought struck her.
&ldquo;He has them all now; he must have; the chest
was empty. What more can he want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She recalled Jeanne&rsquo;s story of her flight up
the ladder in that vast steel dome. &ldquo;He was
about to speak to her, touched her on the
shoulder. What did he want? He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>Her car shuddered slightly, then came to a
halt. They had reached the two hundred foot
level where one boards the Sky Ride.</p>
<p>Without really willing it, she allowed herself
to be carried out with the crowd.</p>
<p>She was standing there only half conscious
of the rocket car just loading before her, still
asking herself questions. &ldquo;Should she tell
Jeanne Erik Nord&rsquo;s story? What should she
do about the whole affair? Should she tell
Erik what she knew? Should&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of a sudden, eyes wide, arms extended, she
sprang forward. But she was just one step too
late. The door closed. The rocket car went
shooting on its way. And in it, smiling sardonically
no doubt, was the long-eared Chinaman.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Jeanne went for a stroll on the boulevard
that night. And she wore not her own modest
sport coat but one of Lorena LeMar&rsquo;s wraps,
a superb creation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You must do this,&rdquo; the screen star had insisted.
&ldquo;You must become accustomed to
wearing these things. And you <i>must</i> wear
them, you know. You couldn&rsquo;t be Lorena LeMar
without them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne had not objected in the least. The
truth was, she loved fine clothes. And this
was such a &ldquo;darb&rdquo; of a cape: midnight-blue
satin trimmed with real white fox, the sort of
thing that catches the eye of every passer-by;
that causes them to turn and stare.</p>
<p>And to stroll on the boulevard as she had
seen so many fine ladies do! Ah, that would
be heavenly!</p>
<p>And it was all of that. One fact troubled
her a little; she was alone. She would have
felt better with a woman companion dressed
as she was, or a gentleman in evening clothes
and a high hat.</p>
<p>But then, Jeanne was at heart a gypsy.
Gypsies are never afraid, nor do they mind
being alone.</p>
<p>There are beautiful shops on the boulevard.
The windows of Paris are not more gay than
are those of our boulevards. Jeanne went window-shopping.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Five hundred a week!&rdquo; she whispered to
herself. &ldquo;Two weeks. A whole thousand dollars
to spend as I please! No one shall say:
&lsquo;This is an inheritance. It belongs to the past
and to the future.&rsquo; I shall spend it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But two weeks of being Lorena LeMar!&rdquo;
She sighed heavily. &ldquo;It will be so difficult!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well!&rdquo; She drew the gorgeous cape
about her, snuggled her head in the soft fur,
and for the moment felt quite recompensed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have that dress,&rdquo; she told herself,
stopping before a window. &ldquo;Nile-green. The
color suits me well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And some perfume.&rdquo; She paused again.
&ldquo;That great bottle cut like a diamond. I love
bottles, the fantastic sort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And shoes!&rdquo; She was a veritable Cinderella
dreaming dreams that night. &ldquo;Shoes!
There are some darling ones. Golden shoes to
match the nile-green dress. And only forty
dollars. Think of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, she was a joyous little Cinderella. But
all her joy vanished on the instant.</p>
<p>Of a sudden three very much over-dressed
young men swooped down upon her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lorena! Lorena LeMar!&rdquo; they shouted in
a chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, such a night as we shall make
of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne was pleased and frightened at one
and the same time; pleased that she had copied
the LeMar manner so well that her friends
were thoroughly deceived; frightened at being
alone at such a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no you won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; She tried in vain to
steady her voice. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m doing a picture; on
the water-wagon and all that, till it&rsquo;s finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water-wagon! Water-wagon!&rdquo; they shouted
in derision, crowding about her. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a
good one! A real wise crack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of a sudden the little French girl&rsquo;s world
whirled about her. When it steadied she happened
to see, by the most fortunate chance in
the world, a familiar figure standing by the
corner of a skyscraper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>In appearance this person was not so very
different from the three nearer at hand. Natty
brown suit, black derby, bright tie, spats, and
all that. But his face! Ah, there you had it!
His cheeks wore a healthy glow. His muscles
were smooth and hard. In the eyes of these
three who had so suddenly come upon her
there was a nervous twitch. Their faces spoke
of excess: too much money, too much fun, too
many hours in a day, too much everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right!&rdquo; She tossed her head in the
LeMar manner. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go. Which way? Over
here?&rdquo; She walked rapidly toward the one on
the corner.</p>
<p>Caught off their guard, the gay trio followed.
Not until it was too late did they realize
that they had been tricked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, hello, my good friend Pat!&rdquo; Jeanne
called suddenly, as if the meeting had been by
chance. She grasped the firm hand of the one
on the corner. &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; she trilled, &ldquo;this is Pat
Murphy. He&rsquo;s a detective, aren&rsquo;t you, Pat?
Show them your star, Pat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat grinned as he threw open his coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been looking for pickpockets and&mdash;and
mashers, haven&rsquo;t you, Pat?&rdquo; Jeanne gave her
detective friend a look.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. Just anything. A fellow&rsquo;s gotta
make a pinch now and then to hold his job.&rdquo;
Pat was still grinning. For all that, a queer
something had stolen into his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh say, George!&rdquo; one of the joy-hunting
trio exclaimed. &ldquo;Forgot something, didn&rsquo;t we?
Directors&rsquo; meeting, or something like that. It
was at ten sharp, wasn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awfully sorry!&rdquo; He turned hurriedly to
Jeanne. &ldquo;Be seeing you again, LeMar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be seeing you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be&mdash;&rdquo; They were gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, they forgot something!&rdquo; Pat chuckled.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll I do? Go and get them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, please don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Jeanne grasped his
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;they thought I
was some one else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This LeMar person? Well, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not, really.&rdquo; She gave him a knowing
look. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just Petite Jeanne, the little
French girl who lived with Bihari the gypsy.
You know that, Pat. You&rsquo;ve known it quite
a long while.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; she added hastily, &ldquo;if you
see Lorena LeMar, who looks just like me,
having any trouble, you just march right up
and say: &lsquo;What&rsquo;s all this about?&rsquo; Will you?&rdquo;
She gave his arm a squeeze and was gone.</p>
<p>Dashing to a corner she boarded a bus and
was whirled away. No more window-shopping
for her that night. Only her own top floor
rooms with the door safely locked could still
her heart&rsquo;s wild beating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Lorena LeMar yet,&rdquo; she thought, as
fresh consternation seized her. &ldquo;Yet I am
threatened with the doubtful kindness of her
friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know,&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;They were
only three gay play-boys out for a good time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when you don&rsquo;t know what play-boys
are like, when you haven&rsquo;t the least notion
what they expect of you&mdash;how terrifying!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old Pat!&rdquo; she thought with a sigh.
&ldquo;He saved me that time. To think what it
means, this having humble friends all strewn
along your pathway, scores and scores of just
common folks, your friends!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But why not?&rdquo; She laughed a little laugh.
&ldquo;Am I not myself only Petite Jeanne, friend
of the gypsies, humblest of them all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she hurried home to lock the door, hang
the beautiful robe carefully in a corner, settle
herself in a great shabby chair and give herself
over to watching the rocket cars streak
across the sky far above the great Fair.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>And in one of these cars, hoping against
hope that she might at the other end catch up
with the long-eared Chinaman, was Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No chance!&rdquo; she breathed a moment later,
as she sent one wide sweeping glance across
the landing platform. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone. But which
way? Down or across?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Choosing to re-cross the broad expanse, she
once more boarded a rocket car and went
speeding away.</p>
<p>This time, having all but given up hope of
catching the fugitive, she gave herself over to
enjoyment of the moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>Never, though she rode the Sky Ride a
thousand times, would she lose that feeling
of breath-taking thrill that came over her as,
hanging high in air, she watched the ever
changing lights and the milling throng upon
the land, the flashing fountains, the darting
boats on the lagoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s marvelous!&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;Why must
one be disturbed by the problems of others?
Why should not one&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more they were across. She leaped to
her feet, was first at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! There he is! He&mdash;he&rsquo;s going
down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaping for the descending car, she caught
it just in time, only to find herself wedged in
between a very fat man and two extremely
tall women. The Chinaman was in the car, of
that she was sure. Yet, crane her neck as she
might, she could not catch sight of him.</p>
<p>Nor was she more fortunate upon landing.
He was gone before she caught a glimpse of
him. Only one thing she knew, he had gone
toward the lagoon. Throngs were pressing in
that direction. All other avenues were clear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>Following more by instinct than knowledge,
she arrived at the shore of the lagoon just
in time to see a fluttering yellow jacket go
gliding across the water in a Dodge-Em.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; She crowded a young couple aside,
pressed a half dollar into the starter&rsquo;s hand,
leaped into a Dodge-Em and was away.</p>
<p>A Dodge-Em is a curious sort of boat. It is
short and broad, is very heavy and has a motor
that appears to run forever. That it does not
run forever Florence was to learn later, to her
sorrow.</p>
<p>You may stand on the edge of a Dodge-Em.
It will not tip you out. You may run it nose
first into another Dodge-Em or into a stone
wall&mdash;yet you will not harm the Dodge-Em.
It has a solid rubber prow and heavily padded
sides. A truly remarkable craft is a Dodge-Em.
Only one thing you cannot do; you can
never make a Dodge-Em go faster than its accustomed
speed, which is some four miles per
hour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>This last Florence learned to her great disgust.
Step on the gas as she might, and did,
she could get no burst of speed from that indolent
Dodge-Em.</p>
<p>So, in the end, she lost the race. Having
crossed the lagoon, the fleeing one abandoned
his boat, climbed the breakwater and disappeared
in the Florida orange grove that by
some touch of magic had been made to grow
on the shores of Chicago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; she sighed, settling back in her
seat. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a grand night for dreaming, and
who could fail to dream at night in a slow old
Dodge-Em. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello there! Out for a ride?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Erik Nord who called from another
Dodge-Em.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did&mdash;did you see him, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke before she thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;er&mdash;well, there was a curious sort of
person out here on the water. Gone now.&rdquo;
She would not tell him, not just yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s double up,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;Fine
night for sport.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>So it happened that she found herself seated
in his Dodge-Em, gliding across the blue waters.</p>
<p>The hour was late. There were few boats
on the lagoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer, the things you can do with these
things.&rdquo; He steered his craft toward the shadows.
In the shadows was another Dodge-Em.
Without appearing to plan it, he allowed his
boat to strike the other a glancing blow.</p>
<p>Came a scream from the other boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! Watch out! What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg your pardon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Erik and Florence glided away. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he
chuckled, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t hurt &rsquo;em, these Dodge-Ems.
Don&rsquo;t hurt the spooners to shake &rsquo;em
up a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; Florence gripped his arm. He
was headed square for a Dodge-Em coming
from the other way. Too late. Came a sudden
jolt, a growl from a placid fat man who, up
to that moment, had been dreaming along in
his own slow way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope, you can&rsquo;t hurt them. And they can&rsquo;t
hurt you!&rdquo; Once again they were away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>They passed out no more sudden shocks that
night, but gliding down the lagoon and back
again, talked of many things, of customs in
China, of temples and gardens, of America
and her own ways and of the great Fair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a pleasure to be with you,&rdquo; he
said, as he bade her good-night at the gate.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping we meet again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping.&rdquo; She hurried away into the
night.</p>
<p>There was little need to hope. They would
indeed be together again and that under the
most unusual circumstances.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br />DANCES AND DREAMS</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne, what can you be doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence stared at her eccentric little
friend in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But can you not see?&rdquo; Jeanne did not pause
for an instant. &ldquo;I am doing a gypsy dance,
practicing for my so very wonderful moving
picture. We begin rehearsals to-morrow, and
must I not be prepared?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence could say no more. The whole affair
was too fantastic for words. Here was
Jeanne in the sumptuous apartment of Lorena
LeMar. She was clothed in a filmy thing of
nile-green that floated around her as clouds
float about a mountain peak. She was as radiant,
too, as any mountain peak at dawn. She
was doing one of her gypsy dances, one of
those exotic, fairy-like dances that, now
dreamy, now wild as a bird in flight, drug
one&rsquo;s very senses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But Jeanne!&rdquo; she exclaimed, when at last
the little French girl threw herself upon a low
couch. &ldquo;Your moving picture is to be one of
those simple, human affairs, a story of the
Cumberlands. You are to be Zola, an innocent
little mountain child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes!&rdquo; Jeanne sat up. Vibrant, alive to
the very tips of her toes, she shook her finger
at Florence. &ldquo;There is the trouble! No contrast,
none at all. And what is a movie, what
can any dramatic thing be, without contrast?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Zola,&rdquo; she hurried on, &ldquo;is not so simple
as you think.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember she is rescued from a car-load
of soft coal, very black, and she is
scrubbed up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Florence smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; Jeanne struck a dramatic pose.
&ldquo;When she is washed up she is introduced to
the president of the railroad. He thinks she is
a&mdash;how would you say it?&mdash;a &lsquo;wow&rsquo;!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So! He takes her home. He has a son and
a daughter about her own age. This daughter
dresses her up in this.&rdquo; She touched the filmy
gown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are in a place like this.&rdquo; She glanced
about the apartment. &ldquo;Only grander, much
grander; you know: high ceilings, marble pillars,
ancestral portraits, butler, and all that.&rdquo;
She threw her arms wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they have dressed our Zola of the
box car up, she does like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again she went drifting like a butterfly
across the room and again alighted upon
her downy perch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; she cried exultantly, &ldquo;they <i>know</i>
she is a wow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Jeanne,&rdquo; Florence objected, &ldquo;where
could a little mountain girl learn that dance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gypsies, traveling gypsies. They go everywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;when Zola does that
dance, they want to keep her&mdash;just the way
you&rsquo;d like to keep a beautiful wild bird who
flies into your window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They do keep her, too, for a few days. But
the little wild thing longs for her mountain
home. So, one starry night, she folds up the
gorgeous pink nightie they have given her,
puts on her old calico dress and steals away,
back to her home on the side of Big Black
Mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Contrast! Is it not
wonderful?&rdquo; Once again, like some strange
tropical bird, she drifted across the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Jeanne!&rdquo; Again the skeptic protested.
&ldquo;Is all this in the scenario?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet. I am putting it in to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Putting it in?&rdquo; Florence was aghast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. And why not? Why must one
be a star, a movie queen, if she is not to have
her own way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Lorena LeMar is gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. She &rsquo;phoned me this morning, only
a few words. She was off on the yacht. I must
move in this very day. To-morrow we must
rehearse. And <i>voila</i>! Here we are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you do not know where you can reach
her in case&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In case what?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In case they detect that you are an impostor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, my friend, not an impostor!&rdquo;
Jeanne held up her hands in horror. &ldquo;Only a
twin star.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or in case you fail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fail? But how could I? The movie is already&mdash;how
shall I say it?&mdash;a flop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&mdash;I shall make it a grand success. I,
Petite Jeanne, who has never failed. Nevair!
I have willed that this so beautiful picture
shall be a success!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s voice was deep and low,
&ldquo;here&rsquo;s wishing you success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow&mdash;&rdquo; She spoke again after some
moments of silence. &ldquo;To-morrow will tell the
story. If you can carry it off to-morrow you
are on your way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes!&rdquo; Jeanne was drooping a little
now. She was like a butterfly who has ridden
the sunbeams long and far. &ldquo;Ah, yes. To-morrow
we shall know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br />TWO BLACK HORSES AND A COFFIN</h2>
<p>For a full half hour the little French girl
reposed upon that luxurious couch. Now
and again her slender fingers touched the
folds of her filmy gown. Often her eyes wandered
from pictures to tapestries, then to little
touches everywhere that told of lavish expenditure.</p>
<p>As a kitten lying on the doorstep basks in
the sunshine, she basked in the warmth of elegance
that was all about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Lorena LeMar,&rdquo; she was telling herself.
&ldquo;I am no longer a very careful little
French girl. I am care-free, extravagant. I
must tip the porter and the bell boy. I must
ride in a taxi. I must&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed, springing to her feet.
&ldquo;I came near to forgetting. We must go to
the Tavern. I must see Jensie.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;To-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne was out of her finery and into street
clothes in a jiffy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now down the elevator and into a taxi.&rdquo;
They were away like a streak. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she
explained, &ldquo;there is so very much I do not
know about those blessed mountains. Jensie
must tell me. She must go with me to-morrow.
Ah! That most terrible to-morrow!&rdquo; she
sighed.</p>
<p>Florence scarcely heard her. She was thinking
of many things, of the long-eared Chinaman,
of Erik Nord&rsquo;s story, of the three-bladed
knife and last but not least of Jensie and her
&ldquo;haunts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne,&rdquo; she said quite suddenly, &ldquo;you
didn&rsquo;t believe that, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe what?&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s tone showed her
astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Florence laughed, &ldquo;I forgot you were
not reading my mind. You don&rsquo;t believe that
a ghost was playing the reed organ in the Tavern
that night, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What should one believe? You saw no
one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the doors were locked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The windows, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, what shall we say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence gave up. Jeanne was at heart a
gypsy. And for gypsies all manner of curious
creatures are real, ghosts and devils, goblins
and witches, all quite real, so what <i>could</i> she
say?</p>
<p>It was a dark and gloomy night. Black
clouds hurried over the black waters of Lake
Michigan. The Tavern seemed dark, mysterious,
uninviting. Yet, as ever, there was the
pale light, the low fire of coals, the slender girl
scrubbing on hands and knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jensie,&rdquo; said Jeanne. Her voice was low
and friendly when at last they sat before the
fire, which had been made to glow a little.
&ldquo;Jensie, when the big show is over, shall you
go back to your mountain home?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is beautiful.&rdquo; Jensie spoke slowly, and
with seeming reluctance. &ldquo;Y-e-s, I shall probably
go back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you do not wish it?&rdquo; Jeanne was surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been through eighth grade down
there. It is as far as I can go. I walked four
miles every morning and night for that. I&mdash;I
would like to study&mdash;study more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s voice was low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a place&mdash;&rdquo; The mountain girl&rsquo;s
voice took on a new note of enthusiasm. &ldquo;Such
a beautiful place! A school. Lena, my chum,
is there now. Her father has a coal mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this place&mdash;&rdquo; She stared at the fire.
&ldquo;There are trees, great spreading elm trees,
very old. And the brown stone building at the
top of the hill is old, all grown over with ivy.
Some of the teachers are old too. Their hair
is like silver. But they are kind, oh so very
kind. And they teach you so much. I have
visited there. I know.&rdquo; Her voice fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it far?&rdquo; Jeanne asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only an hour&rsquo;s ride from here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We shall go there some time, you and I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Jensie&mdash;&rdquo; The little French girl was
all business now. &ldquo;To-morrow I must go out
to the lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where they make moving pictures. Will
you go with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you help me? Will you tell me if the
trees are wrong, if the porch on the cabin is
right, if the old mountaineer says his lines
right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll do all I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jensie,&rdquo; Jeanne threw her arms about her.
&ldquo;You are a dear! We will make a picture, oh,
such a marvelous picture of the land where
your great Lincoln was born. And I&mdash;I shall
be famous as&mdash;as Lorena LeMar. And you,
ah, well, I shall not tell you now, but if we succeed
you shall have something so very wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Releasing her little mountain friend, she
went flying away down the dark room in a
wild gypsy dance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>Ten seconds later, she was back on tiptoe,
her face white with terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hearse!&rdquo; she whispered hoarsely.
&ldquo;There are now two black horses and a coffin.
It moves! Oh, it moves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a full five minutes before even the
stout-hearted Florence found courage to drive
her reluctant feet down the long room. When
she did, and had taken one look out of the window,
she returned in haste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; she murmured hoarsely, &ldquo;the
hearse is gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you!&rdquo; Jeanne repeated. &ldquo;Two black
horses and a coffin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haunts!&rdquo; Jensie&rsquo;s tone was solemn. &ldquo;The
hearse will be back there in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will it?&rdquo; Florence asked herself.</p>
<p>Gliding silently out of the room, they locked
the door, then hurried away into the darkness
with not a single backward look.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br />TRANSFORMING A MOUNTAIN</h2>
<p>If Jeanne carried her heart in her mouth as
she passed through the gate and walked
out on the lot of that &ldquo;Little Bit of Hollywood&rdquo;
in Chicago that day, neither her face
nor her feet betrayed her. She was smiling.
Her feet moved in a sort of rhythmic motion
that was almost a dance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come over here.&rdquo; She steered Jensie, who
was at her side, into the shadow of the stadium
for spectators.</p>
<p>Before the stadium, a proper distance off, a
liberal section of a mountain had been reproduced.
This was surprisingly real with trees,
bushes, grass and rocks. Real flowers were in
bloom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>This did not astonish Jeanne. She had become
accustomed to the magic of Chicago
scenery. It came and went, she knew that well
enough. Four months before this greatest of
all Fairs had opened there had not been a tree
nor even a shrub upon its grounds. And now,
there they were, hundreds of trees, some towering
fifty feet in air, thousands of shrubs,
miles of hedges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magic,&rdquo; Jeanne murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very beautiful.&rdquo; Jensie&rsquo;s voice was
low. &ldquo;A very beautiful mountain. But it&rsquo;s not
Big Black Mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Tell me!&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s voice was eager.</p>
<p>Jensie did tell her. For a full quarter of an
hour Jeanne listened, and not a word escaped
her.</p>
<p>When at last a short chubby man, who
walked with a slight limp, appeared at the foot
of the mountain she was ready. That Lorena
LeMar was capable of an imperious manner
befitting a queen, she knew well enough. She
was Lorena LeMar now. She would be imperious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Miss LeMar!&rdquo; The little man gripped
the tips of her fingers. &ldquo;What a day!&rdquo; he enthused.
&ldquo;It is so bright, like a child with a
washed face. And look! What a mountain I
have got for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne looked into his bright little eyes. She
was shaking at the knees, but her voice was
steady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very pretty mountain, Mr. Soloman.
But it&rsquo;s not right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? Not right, you say?&rdquo; He
stared in unfeigned astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This story,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;is about Big
Black Mountain. You have pines, young pines
all over it. There are no pines on Big Black
Mountain. There is mountain ivy, rhododendrons
and dogwood in bloom. That&rsquo;s the title,
&lsquo;When the Dogwood Is in Bloom.&rsquo; Where is
it? Not a twig!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Miss LeMar, you know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know.&rdquo; Jeanne was going fast now.
&ldquo;You think the story can never be on the
screen. What of that? These people who come
to see pictures taken, many of them have traveled
in the mountains of Kentucky and Virginia.
They will look at your mountain and
laugh.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Laugh? Laugh at me! At Abe Soloman!&rdquo;
The little director fairly danced. &ldquo;I shall have
it changed. You shall have your way, your
ivy and your dogwood and what was it you
said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhododendrons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and your dogwood, all over the lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thanks, Mr. Soloman.&rdquo; The queen
held out an imaginary sceptre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mr. Soloman,&rdquo; Jeanne had intended
going no further that day, but an irresistible
impulse carried her on, &ldquo;we can make a success
of this picture, a real big success!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The small eyes gave her a look that bored
like a gimlet into her very soul. Had he
guessed? Had she betrayed herself? She felt
that her trembling knees would betray her.
Too late now. She took a fresh start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a truly beautiful story. All it lacks is
contrast. When this mountain is done over it
will do. We&mdash;we can shoot the indoor scenes
in some fine home. I&mdash;I have rich friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indoor scenes? Miss LeMar, there are no
indoor scenes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but Mr. Soloman!&rdquo; In her eagerness
Jeanne had her hand on the little man&rsquo;s shoulder.
&ldquo;There must be indoor scenes. All this,
this outside beauty and simplicity is fine, but
there must be a palace, silks, gold, grandeur,
just for contrast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Zola, the little mountain girl, gets
to Louisville in a box car she must be taken
up by rich people who live in a grand house.
They must dress her up in gowns, silk gowns
and all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne was running down like an eight-day
alarm clock, but the little man did not appear
to notice it. Before he caught up with her she
was off again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These people!&rdquo; She waved a hand at the
half-filled stadium. &ldquo;They come from everywhere.
If they see a little bit of a feature picture
shot, they&rsquo;ll want to see the finished
picture. That&rsquo;s natural. Put up a big sign
where they can see it. &lsquo;The picture now being
made is WHEN THE DOGWOOD IS IN
BLOOM. See it in your home theater next
month.&rsquo; And won&rsquo;t they be there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And how!&rdquo; the little man muttered hoarsely,
as he gripped her hand hard. &ldquo;Miss LeMar,
you are a vunder! A vunder! How did you
ever get that vay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not daring to utter another word, Jeanne
fled precipitately from the spot.</p>
<p>As she rested in the shadow of the stadium,
trying in vain to still her wildly beating heart,
momentous questions crowded her brain. Had
she gotten away with it? Had she truly? It
seemed impossible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a Jew, Mr. Soloman is a Jew. And
whoever deceived a Jew? They are the keenest
people living. I didn&rsquo;t know he was a Jew.
If I had known&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>If she had known, what then? Would she
have refused? She did not know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing for it now but to go on
until some one shouts: &lsquo;Stop!&rsquo;&rdquo; she assured
herself as her mind sobered and her heart
ceased its wild flutter.</p>
<p>She was still very much in the doldrums
when, hours later, she sat wrapped in a satin
bathrobe, looking out at the city by night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I only were not so impulsive!&rdquo; she was
saying to Florence. &ldquo;I meant to unfold my
bright ideas one at a time. And there I blurted
them out all at once, like some little child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;he says there&rsquo;ll be
nothing more done on the picture for two
days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing more!&rdquo; Her tone took on a bitter
tinge. &ldquo;Nothing has been done. We went
through the motions and the dialogue to-day;
did it just the best we knew how, too! The
camera men seemed to be making shots. But
it was all a fake. People in the stadium got
a big kick out of it. But it made me feel all
sick inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The others in the cast are so fine, too.&rdquo;
Her voice changed. &ldquo;This boy who&rsquo;s playing
the part of an Italian riding into the mountains
on a donkey is a dear. Just a kid, but
such smooth cheeks, such big eyes, such black
hair!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s nice! Not hard as steel the way
you expect movie men to be. He told me this
was the first real part he&rsquo;d ever been in, and
oh, how he did want it to be a success! But
he&rsquo;d heard it was all set to be a flop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you tell him you were going to
make it a grand success?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&mdash;&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s voice trailed off. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
couldn&rsquo;t. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need more faith,&rdquo; Florence said quietly.
&ldquo;Did you ever think, Jeanne, that nothing
really worth while is ever accomplished without
a tremendous amount of faith? You must
believe in things and in people. You must believe
that this picture is awfully worth while.
You must believe in Mr. Soloman and your
young Italian. Most of all, you must believe
in yourself! Faith! That&rsquo;s a grand word!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And I <i>will</i> have faith!&rdquo; Springing to
her feet, Jeanne went into such a wild whirl
as set her blood racing and brought her back
to her place at last with cheeks as rosy as
those of her little Kentucky mountain friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what?&rdquo; she whispered, as if
afraid of being overheard. &ldquo;Jensie told me the
old hearse at the back of the Tavern was in its
place as usual this morning!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. What did you expect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there were horses!&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s tone carried
conviction. &ldquo;There were two black horses.
I saw them. And there was a coffin! I saw
that too. And the horses were hauling the
hearse away!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br />MAGIC FROM THE EAST</h2>
<p>Long after Florence had retired for the
night Jeanne paced slowly back and forth
in that magnificently furnished living room.
Her bare feet sank deep in the softest of Oriental
rugs. Her filmy gown shimmered in the
moonlight.</p>
<p>Oblivious of all these surroundings, Jeanne
was deep in thought. &ldquo;Faith!&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;Faith! Faith in one&rsquo;s self, in one&rsquo;s associates,
one&rsquo;s tasks. Faith in one&rsquo;s future. Faith in a
kind Providence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith. Faith. Ah, yes, I shall have faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the future? How strange the past had
been! In her thoughts three-bladed knives,
Buddhas and curious Oriental banners were
strangely mixed with log cabins, a hearse
drawn by black horses, and an organ playing
itself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, but the future!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;There is always a to-morrow, to-morrow, and
to-morrow. The grand, good, golden future!
Who can be afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that she snapped out the light to stand
looking down upon the vast, mysterious city
until the distant chimes rang out the hour of
two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;My hour of enchantment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment she stood with bowed head
as if in prayer. After that, for long hours, this
entrancing room knew her not. For long hours
she was wrapped in sleep.</p>
<p>It was well that she had faith in the future
for to-morrow was to bring events mysterious
and terrifying.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>The clock was preparing to strike the hour
of ten on the following night before she ventured
forth from her well-kept fortress, Lorena
LeMar&rsquo;s apartment. She had not forgotten
her narrow escape from Miss LeMar&rsquo;s friends,
the three rich and very badly spoiled play-boys.
&ldquo;Not that they were likely to do me any
real harm,&rdquo; she had confided to Florence.
&ldquo;They were out for one wild night and wished
me to join them. And that for me?&rdquo; She had
made a face. &ldquo;No! No! Not for me! Never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That she might escape danger from this
quarter, she had garbed herself in her ancient
gypsy costume of bright red and had hidden
herself inside a long drab coat that came to
her ankles.</p>
<p>She realized that perfect safety was to be
had only by remaining inside. But who wants
perfect safety? Certainly not our little French
girl.</p>
<p>As a further precaution she descended a
back stairway and left the building from a
little-used doorway.</p>
<p>A half hour later she might have been found
in the throng of joy hunters on the Midway
of the great Fair.</p>
<p>She had just emerged from a breath-taking
crush when off to the right she caught sight
of a curious group gathered about some person
beating a drum.</p>
<p><i>Tum</i>, <i>tum</i>, <i>tum</i>, the dull monotony of beats
played upon her ears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>Having joined the circle, she found herself
looking at a very dark-skinned person with
deep, piercing eyes. The man wore a long
white robe. On his head was something resembling
a Turkish towel twisted into a large
knot.</p>
<p>Seated on the ground near this man were
two others quite as dark as he. One was beating
a curious sort of drum, the other squeaking
away at something resembling a flute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now watch! I will make him go up! Up!
He will climb the rope. He will disappear utterly.
Utterly!&rdquo; The dark man&rsquo;s voice, coming
as it did from deep down in his throat, suggested
that he might be talking from a well.</p>
<p>Upon hearing these words a small man
stepped forward. The dark-faced one drew a
circle about this little man.</p>
<p>At once the dark one began to whirl, then
to dance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>Jeanne had witnessed many strange dances,
but none so weird as this. The man whirled
round and round until his robe seemed a winding
sheet for a ghost. He began revolving
about in a circle. And inside that circle stood
the little man who was, Jeanne discovered,
dressed in a curious sort of yellow gown.</p>
<p>Faster and faster went the drum beats,
squeak-squeak went the flute, wilder and
wilder flew the dancer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can be going to happen?&rdquo; the girl
asked herself. In a vague sort of way she
wished herself somewhere else, but to her
astonishment she found herself unable to
move.</p>
<p>Then a discovery, that under normal circumstances
must have fairly bowled her over, came
to her as in a dream: The little man standing
there in the center garbed in an orange gown
was none other than the long-eared Chinaman
who had snatched the three-bladed knife from
her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can get him. Get him now,&rdquo; a low
voice seemed to whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, but you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; a stronger voice
appeared to reach her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to see
this thing through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so she was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>Of a sudden, without for an instant abandoning
his mad whirl, the dark-faced conjurer
from India, for such he was, produced a rope.
Three times he lifted his hand high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now watch! Watch closely. He will go
up.&rdquo; In his voice there was a strange hypnotic
cadence.</p>
<p>Like a thing shot from a gun, the rope rose
straight in the air and, in so far as Jeanne&rsquo;s
eyes told her the truth, remained there standing
on air.</p>
<p>The next instant a figure all in orange began
passing up that rope. Up, up a yard, two
yards, three, four, five. Up, up until the darkness
appeared to stretch out black-robed arms
to receive him.</p>
<p>Then of a sudden the dark-faced one ceased
whirling. The drum gave forth one more loud
boom, the flute one more squeak, and all was
still.</p>
<p>With a sigh that was all but a whisper,
Jeanne took one long, full breath.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes for an instant, then
opened them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>To her astonishment she saw no dark-faced
one in a white robe. The musicians, too, were
gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Chinaman!&rdquo; she exclaimed aloud.
&ldquo;He has vanished also!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; It was Erik Nord,
the man from China, who spoke to her. He
had just come up. &ldquo;You must have seen a
ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I&mdash;I saw a Chinaman go up a rope
that was fastened to nothing but air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no rope,&rdquo; Erik Nord laughed,
&ldquo;at least not in air, and no Chinaman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! I saw him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps. But he did not go up the
rope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man in the white robe,&rdquo; he explained,
&ldquo;was India&rsquo;s cleverest conjurer. With his
weird music and wild whirling he cast a spell
over you. You saw what he wished you to see.
Perhaps you were hypnotized. Who can say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that Chinaman!&rdquo; Jeanne murmured.
&ldquo;He was&mdash;was&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>She was about to tell the story of the three-bladed
knife. Thinking better of it, she made
some commonplace remark, then bade this
chance acquaintance good-night as he hurried
away to fill an engagement.</p>
<p>It is little wonder that, after such a mystifying
experience as this, Jeanne should
straightway walk into a trap. This is exactly
what she did.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br />A SCREAM BRINGS STARTLING RESULTS</h2>
<p>Erik Nord was to be found anywhere
and everywhere. Young, very strong, full
of the vigor of youth, he was in what was to
him a strange land&mdash;America. Little wonder,
then, that an hour after he had imparted valuable
information to Petite Jeanne, Florence
should have come upon him standing near the
breakwater of the lagoon.</p>
<p>He was looking at a ship, a battered old
windjammer tied up there by the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stout little old boat, that!&rdquo; he said to her
with a friendly smile. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help but admire
her, can you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Florence wondered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know the story? Come on
board, and I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>They mounted the gangplank, then wandered
across the upper deck and descended to
the deck below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See those!&rdquo; Nord touched a ten-inch hand-hewn
beam of ironwood. &ldquo;Look at those
knees! All hand-hewn. Know how old this
ship is? Fifty years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;And yet, when
Richard Byrd wanted a ship that would carry
him safely through the polar ice of the Antarctic,
Roald Amundsen, who had sailed on
this ship as a boy, said: &lsquo;She&rsquo;s the one you
want.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They found her,&rdquo; his voice was mellow,
almost tender, &ldquo;tied up to a dock far north
in Norway. They&rsquo;d thought she was through;
everyone who knew her thought that. And
yet, isn&rsquo;t it magnificent! To-day she&rsquo;s about
the most famous ship afloat. Byrd&rsquo;s Polar
Ship, they call her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s Scandinavian built,&rdquo; he said proudly.
&ldquo;My ancestors were Norsemen. Can you blame
me for admiring this old ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Florence. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you told me.
This ship was built right, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Right and honest. They took their time
about it, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if we build our lives that way, right
and honest, taking our time, we&rsquo;ll last, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s reason to hope so.&rdquo; He gave forth
a low chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we go up on deck and sit a while?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it happened that they found themselves
settled comfortably in a dark corner watching
the parade of boats pass by.</p>
<p>It was a warm night. The lagoon was crowded.
All manner of boats were there, speed
boats and tiny motor boats, row boats, canoes,
dugouts and gondolas. For some time Florence
watched in vain for a certain type of boat.
When at last her vigil was rewarded, she received
a shock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she exclaimed, seizing Erik Nord
by the arm. &ldquo;Look there, at that Dodge-Em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s unusual about that?&rdquo; He looked at
her curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But see who&rsquo;s riding in it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A Chinaman.&rdquo; Erik chuckled. &ldquo;Suits their
style. Goes only just so fast. A Chink is seldom
in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look who it really is&mdash;your long-eared
Chinaman! The one who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was not time to finish. One look and
Erik Nord was away, dragging Florence by
the hand across the deck.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Having witnessed the astonishing performance
of Indian magic, Jeanne spent an hour
wandering about the Fair grounds in a sort
of trance. It was impossible to drive from
her highly sensitive mind the memory of the
booming drum, squeaking flute and whirling
magician. And this walking in a trance, as
we have suggested, ended in her undoing.</p>
<p>She had wandered, without thinking much
about it, into an all but deserted corner of the
grounds, when with the suddenness of thought
three figures swooped down upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lorena! Lorena LeMar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound of their voices warned her of
danger, but too late.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The play-boys!&rdquo; Her mind registered these
words, then like a ship sinking at sea her brain
went into a wild whirl.</p>
<p>Before she could scream or flee, they were
upon her, all three of the play-boys. A hand
went over her mouth, others lifted her from
the earth. She was dropped with little ceremony
onto an upholstered seat, a powerful
motor purred, and they were away.</p>
<p>As the car shot down the drive an observer
might have noticed that a tall, thin young
man loitering near had suddenly leaped into
action. Spinning about, he dashed to the nearest
waiting taxi, delivered an order in a low
tone, leaped in and went rushing away in the
direction the car had taken.</p>
<p>Poor little French girl! Once inside that
car she found her head spinning round with
unimaginable terror. What was to happen?
For a time she was unable to think.</p>
<p>When at last a certain degree of composure
took possession of her, the car had passed from
the Fair grounds and was speeding along the
boulevard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They think me Lorena LeMar,&rdquo; she told
herself. She shuddered afresh as she thought
how she had tricked them on that other occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have been furious.&rdquo; Her heart
sank. &ldquo;Miss LeMar had been their playmate
on other occasions; then to treat them like
that!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if I get out of that I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>What would she do? That mattered very
little now. What truly mattered was the problem
of her immediate conduct and ultimate
escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she assured herself, &ldquo;I could
tell them I am not Lorena LeMar. But would
they believe it? Probably not. And if they
did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought of her hopes and plans, of the
movie that had inspired her, of the young
Italian actor who was dreaming dreams, and
of Jensie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;not if I can help it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;ll do! I&rsquo;ll play up to them.
Let them think I am Miss LeMar. They will
want me to dance. Very good, I shall dance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dared think no further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll escape,&rdquo; she told herself stoutly. &ldquo;I
must! But how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her heart sank. Too often she had read of
the cruelties practiced by these rich play-boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They should not be permitted to be at
large!&rdquo; she told herself bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But none of this! I must seem happy, full
of spirits, gay. I must sing, I must dance.
And then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before a three-story gray stone building the
car came to a grinding halt. All the curtains
were drawn, but lights shone through the
cracks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some sort of club,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>If it indeed was a club it was a very little
frequented place. She did not see a person beside
her escort as, carrying out her well-formed
plan, she romped with them up the
steps and into a rather large room where there
were numerous chairs and a rather large
wood-topped table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>At the far end of the room was a broad fireplace
and near it were card tables with cards
scattered over them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A kindergarten for rich play-boys,&rdquo; Jeanne
smiled to herself in spite of her predicament.</p>
<p>Throwing off her dull coat, with an air of
abandon she did a dozen fancy steps across
the polished floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, look!&rdquo; exclaimed the tallest of the
three play-boys. &ldquo;Lorena&rsquo;s a gypsy to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truth was, until that moment Jeanne had
forgotten her gown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she exclaimed in a tone of forced
gaiety. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a gypsy to-night. Shall I dance
my gypsy dance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the table!&rdquo; A pair of stout arms caught
her to toss her up.</p>
<p>Catlike, she landed on her feet. She was
angry. &ldquo;But I must not! I must not be
angry!&rdquo; she told herself fiercely. &ldquo;I must
dance. Time must pass. Surely something
will happen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>Forgetting time and place, she began the
weird, wild dance of the gypsies. That her
audience was impressed she knew at once. So
she prolonged the dance.</p>
<p>All things must have an end. The end of
the dance found her heart all aflutter. What
next?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo! Bravo!&rdquo; they applauded. &ldquo;That
calls for refreshments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking a bottle from a concealed locker, the
shortest of the trio filled four glasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now! A toast!&rdquo; He passed one glass to
her. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to Lorena LeMar! Here&rsquo;s to the
new picture!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the play-boys lifted their glasses
Jeanne followed their example. The stuff in
the glass burned her lips. The glass slipped
from her hand to go crashing upon the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! She dropped it! Too bad! Here&rsquo;s
another.&rdquo; There was a note of insolence in
the voice of the youth as he poured a second
glass. &ldquo;Here! Drink this!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, my friend!&rdquo; Her voice was like thin,
clear ice. &ldquo;No, I will not drink it.&rdquo; No longer
was she Lorena LeMar. She was Jeanne, the
gypsy. In her veins there coursed the wild,
free, fighting spirit of a true vagabond. Had
she possessed a knife.... Ah, well, she had
no knife.</p>
<p>One weapon alone she possessed, truly a
woman&rsquo;s weapon&mdash;a scream.</p>
<p>This weapon she used. Not in vain had she
practiced for hours a stage scream. When her
slender voice rose shrill and high the three
play-boys became rigid as stone.</p>
<p>The effect of that scream was sudden and
most astonishing. Some bulk struck the door.
Again; yet again. Then the lock broke and a
tall, slim youth half stepped, half fell into the
room. He was followed by a taxi driver.</p>
<p>Recovering from his shock, the leader of the
play-boys took a step forward. Hot words
were on his lips. They were not spoken. He
was met by a heavy chair thrown with lightning-like
speed by the astonishing stranger.</p>
<p>Taking him in the pit of the stomach the
chair hurled the play-boy backward into his
companions. Like so many tenpins they went
down with a crash.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>Not a word was spoken as the tall stranger
gathered Jeanne up in his arms, marched out
of the room and down the steps, deposited his
burden in the taxi, sprang in beside her, gave
the driver orders, then watched the building
narrowly as they drove away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I would take my oath I never saw
him,&rdquo; Jeanne whispered to herself. Sinking
deep among the cushions, she suddenly felt
very small, very young and quite helpless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br />THE SLIM STRANGER</h2>
<p>When Erik Nord and Florence caught
sight of the long-eared Chinaman
placidly cruising the lagoon in a Dodge-Em,
Erik, as we have said, led the girl away in hot
pursuit.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, on reaching the nearest
available craft, they found it to be but another
slow going, doddering old Dodge-Em.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take it,&rdquo; Erik decided on the instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have to. Nothing else in sight. Probably
he hasn&rsquo;t seen us. Slip up on him without the
least trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if he goes ashore I&rsquo;ll get him. I can
run. No Chinaman has out-distanced me yet.&rdquo;
He stepped on the gas and they were away,
away at the breakneck speed of four miles an
hour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Think of finding him right here in Chicago!&rdquo;
Erik exulted. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you come to
know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence did not reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; She leaned far forward. &ldquo;There he
goes! He&rsquo;s headed straight down the lagoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never go outside. Probably land.
We&rsquo;ll get him!&rdquo; Erik trod angrily on the lever
that kept the motor going. &ldquo;If only a fellow
could get one burst of speed out of this thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was making that same remark a quarter
of an hour later. The long-eared one had not
gone ashore. Instead, he had headed straight
down the lagoon and out into the open lake
where darkness and silence reigned. And Erik
Nord, with all the stubbornness of his race,
had followed in slow pursuit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a turtle race,&rdquo; he said without apparent
emotion. &ldquo;Two turtles. The question is, which
will tire first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll run out of gas,&rdquo; Florence murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And be stuck out here for the night.&rdquo;
Florence thought this, but did not say it. The
moon would be out in an hour. And then&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>Slowly but doggedly the Dodge-Em pushed
its stout rubber nose through the black water.
The Chinaman, a dark spot above the water,
was ever before them. They did not lose. They
did not gain. They only followed on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been told that a man crossed the lake
in one of these,&rdquo; Erik rumbled. &ldquo;Safe enough,
I guess. Anyway, when you&rsquo;ve lived in China
you get used to any mode of travel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence wondered if they would cross the
lake. &ldquo;And after that?&rdquo; she whispered to herself.
The rumble of the city was dying away
in the distance, the lights of the Fair were
growing dim. It was strange to be out here in
the night with one she had known for so short
a time. And yet this was the turn chance had
taken.</p>
<p>Leaning back, she closed her eyes. It had
been a long day. The night air sweeping in
from the lake fanned her cheek. The darkness
had been kind to her tired eyes. Now she felt
the need for rest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>Did she fall asleep? Perhaps. Perhaps not.
All she knew was that when she opened her
eyes at last she became conscious of a change.
&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Motor stopped. We lose,&rdquo; Erik grumbled.
&ldquo;We lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here we are.&rdquo; She caught a long
breath. The moon was just beginning to roll,
a ball of red, along the black horizon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; Erik agreed, then settled
back comfortably in his corner.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>It was at about this same moment that
Jeanne found herself speeding away in a taxi
with a man she had never seen before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He saved me,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Saved me
from a horrible night. He knew I was there.
How? He willed to get me out of that place.
Why?&rdquo; To these questions she could find no
answers. There was, she believed, but one
thing to do; to sit back and allow the future
to unfold itself.</p>
<p>They were entering the Loop. There was
comfort in that. In the Loop were many people.
And in numbers there is always a degree
of safety.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be in need of a cup of coffee after
that,&rdquo; her companion suggested. &ldquo;Supposing
we stop in here.&rdquo; The cab had stopped before
a well lighted coffee house.</p>
<p>Without a word Jeanne followed him inside
and back to a small table in the rear. &ldquo;Who
is he? What does he want?&rdquo; She was determined
now to see the thing through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Tom Tobin of the <i>News</i>,&rdquo; the strange
rescuer announced when coffee had been ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Jeanne caught her breath. &ldquo;You
were after news! And&mdash;and I&mdash;I will be in
the paper! That explains&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It explains nothing.&rdquo; Tom Tobin&rsquo;s smile
was disarming. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t looking for news,
and this will not get you in the paper. Far
from it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was keeping tab on you,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tab on me?&rdquo; Her wide eyes registered
astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sort of guarding you, if that sounds
better. I did it for a very good reason, too.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he leaned forward over the table,
speaking in a voice scarcely above a whisper,
&ldquo;I know you better than you think. You are
not Lorena LeMar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held up a hand for silence. &ldquo;No use!&rdquo; he
warned. &ldquo;You are the little French girl, Petite
Jeanne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll not betray you.&rdquo; He had read the
consternation in her eyes. &ldquo;Why should I?
You&mdash;you&rsquo;re doing a big thing for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are planning to make a success of the
scenario I wrote, &lsquo;When the Dogwood Is in
Bloom.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wrote it? How&mdash;how wonderful!&rdquo;
Jeanne stretched a slim white hand across the
table. Tom Tobin grasped it frankly. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
luck!&rdquo; His frank eyes shone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here&rsquo;s our coffee. How jolly!&rdquo; Fear
had flown from Jeanne&rsquo;s eyes. She was her
own bright, joyous self once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how could you know I am to make a
success of your picture?&rdquo; she demanded eagerly.
&ldquo;I do not know it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Old Sollie, Mr. Soloman, your producer,
told me. He&rsquo;s all het up about it; says you
showed him how to make a great picture of it
and get a lot of free publicity. He&rsquo;s working
on the scene, got men after real mountain ivy
and rhododendrons and dogwood. Sent for
two log cabins like the ones in the Lincoln
Group, and all that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;Suppose we get together
and work over the dialogue and all
that! Sollie says you know a lot about the
mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve never been there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he told me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know.&rdquo; Jeanne smiled. &ldquo;I have a
friend who prompted me. She has lived there
all her life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she&rsquo;ll help us. We&rsquo;ll work it over
together, beginning to-morrow afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&mdash;&rdquo; Jeanne favored him with her loveliest
smile. &ldquo;That&mdash;how do you say it? That
is a <i>go</i>! Eh, what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; Tom grinned. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get on
grand. You&rsquo;re a regular guy!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; Jeanne laughed a merry
laugh.</p>
<p>A half hour later, as Jeanne entered the lobby
of the hotel after bidding Tom Tobin a
heartfelt &ldquo;Happy dreams!&rdquo; the porter stared
at her for a moment as if uncertain of her
identity, then said in a matter-of-fact tone:
&ldquo;Your trunk has gone up, Miss LeMar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My trunk?&rdquo; She stared. &ldquo;Oh, but I have
not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke short off. Was she about to betray
her secret? She was Miss LeMar. Perhaps
the real Lorena LeMar had ordered a
trunk sent over without informing her.</p>
<p>Her tone changed. &ldquo;Very well. Thank
you.&rdquo; She dropped a coin into his hand, then
hurried away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a trunk?&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;A trunk in
our apartment!&rdquo; An unreasoning terror swept
upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But only a trunk!&rdquo; She shook herself free
of this wild fear. &ldquo;What is a trunk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What indeed?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br />A SOUND IN THE NIGHT</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about that mysterious land,
China.&rdquo; Florence settled back in her
place in the stupid little Dodge-Em that, refusing
to travel farther, had left them stalled
far out on the black waters of night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;China.&rdquo; Erik Nord&rsquo;s tone was full of the
enchanting melody of the Far East. &ldquo;How is
one to tell you of China? There are sampans
where whole families live their lives away,
sampans on the river and great cities on their
banks. Farther up there are villages and on
the river great old junks. Ships from out of
the past, they loom before you in the dark.
You never know whether they are manned by
brigands who will rob you or soldiers who may
take your possessions from you in the name of
the law. You&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Her hand was on his arm. There
had come a sound from the water. &ldquo;Do&mdash;do
you think his Dodge-Em has stalled too?
Wouldn&rsquo;t it be strange if we drifted together
in the moonlight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing would suit me better!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence believed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that long-eared one has the knife,&rdquo;
she told herself as a thrill coursed up her spine.
Closing her eyes she seemed to witness a battle
on the water, a fight between a square-jawed
white man from China whose ancestors
had built boats that were good fifty years
later, and a Chinaman inspired by who knows
what superstitious terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we&rsquo;d sight him!&rdquo; Nord&rsquo;s words
came from between his teeth. &ldquo;I think I might
help out a bit, rip a board off this tub of ours
and use it for a paddle or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems pretty solid.&rdquo; Florence felt the
boat over. &ldquo;Besides, we haven&rsquo;t seen him,
we&rsquo;ve only caught a sound. It might not have
been his boat. Probably his gas held out and
he&rsquo;s gone back to land, vanished by now&mdash;the
vanishing Chinaman.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; Erik&rsquo;s voice took on a new
note, &ldquo;how did it happen you recognized him
out there on the water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;why, I&rsquo;ve seen him before.&rdquo; She was
stalling for time. Should she tell him all about
the chest, the knife, the banners? She was not
proud of the affair. They had been careless,
she could see that now. And yet, if he knew,
they might work together.</p>
<p>She looked away at the golden moon. Her
eyes followed the path it painted across the
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you. It was like
this. We bought that chest full of your treasures
at an auction sale, bought it for I&mdash;I&rsquo;m
ashamed to tell you how little. And now&mdash;now
it&rsquo;s gone; all gone but the chest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He got it, that long-eared one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about it.&rdquo; Erik leaned forward
eagerly.</p>
<p>She told him all there was to tell, described
the knife, the bell and all the banners as best
she could.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;All gone. You have
missed much, and the little ones of China have
missed more. There was a reward for the return
of that chest, five hundred dollars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five hun&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five hundred in gold. With that you could
have visited this land that seems to you so
mysterious. With care you could have stayed
a long time in China, delved into all manner
of Oriental mysteries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it yet!&rdquo; He saw her stout figure
stiffen with resolve. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get that long-eared
one yet! You wait! You shall have all those
treasures back, every one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid! But have a care, my friend.
Have a care!&rdquo; There was a note of warning in
his voice. &ldquo;Those Orientals are dangerous
when some superstitious terror takes possession
of them. There is something we do not
know about those temple adornments; that
knife and bell are forces to fight demons. Who
can say what demons have taken possession
of our vanishing Chinaman? Have a care!
Just when you wish for your very life&rsquo;s sake
that he might vanish, you will find him insisting
upon being very much of a present reality.
He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Again her hand rested on his arm.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>There are certain people who &ldquo;feel&rdquo; events
before they transpire. This, psychologists will
tell you, is intuition. Jeanne&rsquo;s intuition caused
her knees to tremble as she walked from the
elevator to Lorena LeMar&rsquo;s apartment which,
for the time, was her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A trunk,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;A trunk beyond
that door.&rdquo; By this time her key was in the
lock. She wished to turn back; she willed to
go forward. In the end courage won. She
pushed open the door. She entered the room.</p>
<p>But she did not go far. One look was
enough. The trunk, a huge affair such as is
used by commercial traveling men, stood in
the center of the room. Its lid was up. It was
empty! And the whole apartment, as far as
her startled eyes could take it in, was in a state
of wild confusion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>Next, without exactly knowing how it happened,
she found herself outside with the door
locked behind her.</p>
<p>Her heart was beating painfully. As if to
still its wild beating she clutched at her breast.
Her brain was in a state of wild confusion.
For some little time she could not think two
thoughts in a row.</p>
<p>When at last her senses returned it all came
to her in a flash. &ldquo;It is that little yellow man
with the long ears,&rdquo; she assured herself. &ldquo;He
or one of his friends. He believed that those
things, those priceless banners and that curious
bell from the temple, were in this place.
He had himself strapped tight in that monstrous
trunk and shipped himself to this hotel,
&lsquo;To Miss LeMar&rsquo;s apartment.&rsquo; To&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke off. &ldquo;He knows!&rdquo; The thought
fairly floored her. &ldquo;This long-eared one knows
I am not Lorena LeMar. He knows I am Petite
Jeanne. Will he tell? Will he spoil all my
fine plans?&rdquo; Here indeed was a terrible probability.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I make it possible for him to have just
what he wants,&rdquo; she whispered slowly, &ldquo;perhaps
he will go away and no one will know, no
one but Florence and Miss LeMar and Tom
Tobin, who will never tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here indeed was temptation. She did not
know that these treasures had been intended
as a gift to a children&rsquo;s hospital, for the little
ones of China. Florence had not told her. She
only knew that at present they were her own,
that she and Florence had bought them and
had received a bill of sale for them.</p>
<p>Startling as was this revelation, it did not
occupy her thoughts long. Her mind took a
fresh turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Where is she?
The hour is late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again her head was in a whirl. Where
could Florence be?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she is in there! They may have
found her. She may have been murd&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could not say the word. Her love for
her big companion was all but compelling her
to re-enter that room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He may still be there, that little yellow one
with the long ears.&rdquo; She was fairly beside
herself.</p>
<p>Should she call the house detective? This
she feared to do. In the excitement of the moment
she might give away the secret of her
dual personality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! I must not! I must be brave!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again she approached the door. Her
fingers trembled as she fitted key to lock, yet
she did not turn back. The lock clicked. The
door opened. She stepped inside. The door
closed behind her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">CHAPTER XX</span>
<br />PICTURES ON THE CLOUDS</h2>
<p>The sound that came to Florence&rsquo;s listening
ears out there on the lake in the stalled
Dodge-Em was a welcome one: the low <i>put-put</i>
of a motor boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it only comes close enough we&rsquo;re saved
from a night on the water,&rdquo; she said hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chilly business, staying out here,&rdquo; Erik
Nord agreed.</p>
<p>The <i>put-put</i> grew louder. A light came swimming
across the expanse of black water. Now
they saw it and now it was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s passing to the right of us,&rdquo; Erik
judged. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to hail her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Standing up in the boat he cupped his hands
to shout:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ahoy there!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never had Florence heard such a roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahoy there!&rdquo; came floating back faintly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Give us a lift. We&rsquo;re stalled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right O! We&rsquo;re coming!&rdquo; The voice
seemed very far away.</p>
<p>Presently across the shimmering waters of
night a dark bulk loomed.</p>
<p>It was only a fishing boat headed for the
dock. This craft smelled of herring and tar,
but she carried, too, a hearty welcome such as
one might not find on a handsomer boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us yer line!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now! There we are! Where y&rsquo; bound fer
in that thing?&rdquo; the sun-tanned skipper
boomed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nowhere in particular. We want to get
back to the lagoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right O! We&rsquo;ll tow y&rsquo; in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next moment the stranded ones found
themselves leaning back comfortably in the
broad seat, watching the play of moonlight
upon the water that rippled and rolled about
their prow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a grand world to live in,&rdquo; Erik
murmured, &ldquo;if all its people were as simple
and obliging as these fishermen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re common folks.&rdquo; There was a world
of meaning in the girl&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncommon, I&rsquo;d say, very uncommon indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All a matter of point of view, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fishermen had demanded no pay for
their services, were loath in the end to accept
it. They did not, however, depart unrewarded.</p>
<p>When, a half hour later, Florence burst into
the apartment, she found Jeanne sitting before
the window, looking out into the night. The
trunk had been sent to a room where empty
trunks were kept. The apartment was in apple
pie order. Jeanne did not say, &ldquo;Oh, my friend,
such a terrible thing has happened! We have
been searched again.&rdquo; She said nothing at all;
she just kept on looking out into the night.</p>
<p>The reason for this is apparent enough. The
little French girl harbored a secret. This secret
she had hidden even from her bosom pal.
The secret had to do with that laundry bag
still reposing in a cubicle back there in the
small hotel near their own shabby rooms. The
check boy was still custodian of her secret.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>Why did Jeanne guard this secret so closely?
Perhaps for no reason at all. Jeanne was
at heart a gypsy. A gypsy has a reason for
doing a thing if he chooses. A mere impulse
is reason enough for him. Life for him is action,
not thought. He dances, he sings, he
plays the violin. He travels where he will. If
you say to him, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he shrugs his shoulders.
Jeanne was like that.</p>
<p>But to Jeanne, as on other nights long after
Florence was asleep, there came, as she sat
there before the window, strange fantastic pictures
of the past and visions of the future. Of
these she wondered as in a dream.</p>
<p>Clouds had come drifting in from the west.
They filled the sky. From time to time a powerful
radio beacon, swinging in its orbit, appeared
to paint pictures on those clouds. In
Jeanne&rsquo;s fanciful vision these pictures took on
fantastic forms.</p>
<p>Some of the pictures that came to her as she
sat there were vivid, as real as life itself, and
some were as indistinct as a mirage on the far
horizon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>A hearse in the moonlight. &ldquo;A sign.&rdquo; She
shuddered. &ldquo;A hearse with two black horses
and a coffin.&rdquo; Again she shuddered.</p>
<p>But now it was gone. Instead there was a
sloping hillside where little streams rushed
from beneath dark canopies of mountain ivy.
The dark clouds turned white under the powerful
light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will it ever be?&rdquo; She dared to hope now.
&ldquo;Will our moving picture succeed?&rdquo; Tom
Tobin had inspired her. She could see his face
on the clouds. Young, slender, eager, full of
vitality, he invited hope as sunshine invites a
bud to become a flower.</p>
<p>But now in a cavern of the darkened clouds
a great trunk yawned. Out from it, like a jack-in-the-box,
leaped a little yellow man with
long ears. &ldquo;He wants that bell, those banners.
He risks everything to get them. I wonder
why?&rdquo; She mused for a moment; then the
scene in this fairyland of clouds changed once
more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>A slender white cloud curled upward. Its
tip became a rope that rose higher, higher,
higher, toward a dark night sky. Up that rope
a figure appeared to glide. &ldquo;He did go up!&rdquo;
she whispered hoarsely. &ldquo;I saw him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The airplane beacon swung about. The sky
went black. It became dark waters, and on
those waters were two boats gliding one after
the other, moving silently out to sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That long-eared one,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;he
is everywhere at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Florence&mdash;&rdquo; A smile played about her
lips. &ldquo;Florence and that white man from
China. How romantic to be out there with
him beneath the moon all alone! Surely one
may endure mystery, suspense, anything, if it
leads to romance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strangely enough, the night sky took on a
tinge of green. In this she saw a frail child
of France garbed all in green and gold. Her
eyes opened wide. It was her very own self.</p>
<p>Yet even as she looked the picture faded,
and in its place was a broad green hill topped
by a stately building of brown stone. And
after that all visions vanished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>Florence found her there in the morning
fast asleep in the great upholstered chair before
the window. A shaft of sunshine playing
across her face made her seem to smile. A
morning breeze from the lake set her golden
hair waving a salute.</p>
<p>She did not sleep long after Florence had
stolen away to her work, this little French
girl. Tom Tobin had wakened hope in her
heart. He had set her glorious mind to dreaming.
And dreamers seldom sleep too much.</p>
<p>Having wakened, she sprang into action. A
shower, ten minutes of wild dancing to set her
blood racing, a cup of coffee with crisp squares
of hard toast, and she was away.</p>
<p>Gathering up the little mountain girl, Jensie,
she hurried her away to the movie lot.
There, by great good chance, she came upon
Mr. Soloman, who was, after all, only Assistant
Production Manager for a great Hollywood
producer, and no one to be greatly
afraid of.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Miss LeMar!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;How
very good it is to see you. Look! Already
they have mountain ivy and rhododendrons
from the nursery. The dogwood, too, will
come, and there are two cabins to come. And
now, Miss LeMar, might I ask what more
would you suggest?</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Jeanne, pushing Jensie forward,
&ldquo;is my property lady. We will look over the
set together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour later when she and Jensie reappeared
they carried four pages of notes.</p>
<p>Seated there on the improvised hillside in
the sun, they discussed details with the eager
Mr. Soloman, who said, &ldquo;Yes, Miss LeMar.
Yes, Miss LeMar, this also can be done,&rdquo;
through it all. &ldquo;A coonskin drying on the outside
of the cabin, a well with an oaken bucket,
hound dogs, yes, yes, three hound dogs. A
long-barreled rifle. Yes, yes, we will have all
these.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Miss LeMar, I am wiring Hollywood
to-day for approval of my plans. If they say
O. K., then we will have a special car and we
will go to this Big Black Mountain for long
shots and such things that cannot be taken
here. What would you say to that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Soloman!&rdquo; Before Jeanne knew
what she was doing she had kissed the chubby
little man on the cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think, Jensie!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Think of going
right down to your Big Black Mountain! And
of course you must come along!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only for two or three days. We will fix
that.&rdquo; The little man smiled broadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all for to-day?&rdquo; said Jeanne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all, Miss LeMar. You are very
beautiful to-day, Miss LeMar. There is color
in your cheeks. Ha! This is wonderful!&rdquo; He
gave Jeanne such a sharp look that deep in
her soul she trembled. Was he beginning to
guess? And if he knew?</p>
<p>She returned to Lorena LeMar&rsquo;s apartment
with a very sober face. Life had begun to be
quite wonderful. If some one spoiled it all by
a sudden discovery or a betrayal, what then?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXI</span>
<br />WORK AND DREAMS</h2>
<p>By early afternoon Jeanne&rsquo;s old cheerful
smile was back again. And why not?
Was she not seated between two friends, Jensie
and Tom, studying the dialogue of this altogether
absorbing movie that hour by hour
took on a more vivid picture of reality?</p>
<p>They were having a gay time there in Lorena
LeMar&rsquo;s living room. From time to time
peals of laughter came drifting out through
the open window.</p>
<p>Jensie was the critic. And a very expert
critic she turned out to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. He would never say that, your old Jud
who lives at the foot of Big Black Mountain.
He would not say, &lsquo;Those horses are fast
travelers.&rsquo; He&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;Them&rsquo;s the travelin&rsquo;est
hosses I ever most seed.&rsquo; He wouldn&rsquo;t say, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s
done.&rsquo; He&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;I done done it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But Jensie,&rdquo; Jeanne protested, &ldquo;if we
change all this, how are the people going to
know what it&rsquo;s all about? Might as well have
him talk German.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;W-e-l-l, you asked me.&rdquo; Jensie puckered
her fair brow. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way we talk down
there. We don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;rifle,&rsquo; but &lsquo;rifle-gun.&rsquo; We
say &lsquo;we-uns&rsquo; and &lsquo;you-all.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Tom after a moment&rsquo;s thought,
&ldquo;a great deal of that is easy enough to understand.
It does make the whole thing seem a
lot more real. And if we find old Jud talking
too much, why, we&rsquo;ll just shut him up and
make him talk with his hands and his feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And his pistol-gun,&rdquo; Jensie added. &ldquo;Pistol-guns
talk a heap down there in the mountings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all had a good laugh, and once more
the work moved on smoothly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; Jeanne said to Jensie before
bidding her good-bye, &ldquo;to-morrow morning
we will go out to that so beautiful college you
have been telling me about. What do you
say?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; Jensie laughed joyfully, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a
right smart clever idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we shall go.&rdquo; Jeanne gave her hand
a squeeze. &ldquo;I am tired. There are trees, you
say, and grass, very much grass. Good! We
shall sit upon the grass beneath those spreading
elms and forget this noisy city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went. The electric car whirled them
away to the country. It seemed that but a
moment had passed when they found themselves
walking up a path shaded by two rows
of ancient elms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So green the grass!&rdquo; Jeanne murmured.
&ldquo;So graceful the trees and so strong! And
that fine old building of limestone. It is like
France, my so beautiful France!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused. From a smaller building with
very high windows there floated the words of
a song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Singing? It is Chapel! Come!&rdquo; Jeanne
seized Jensie by the hand. &ldquo;Come quick! We
will slip into a back seat. It has been so long,
oh, so long since I heard such singing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>As they entered the door all heads were
bowed in prayer. Deeply religious, as all the
best of her race are, Jeanne bowed her head
reverently.</p>
<p>The prayer at an end, six hundred young
voices burst into song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how they sing it!&rdquo; There were tears
in Jeanne&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;They sing what they believe.
How very, very wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hidden away in a high-backed seat, they
listened to the simple, sincere message of a
white-haired professor as he talked to this silent
audience of young people about God and
His relation to their lives.</p>
<p>Jeanne was strangely silent as she left the
place. Perhaps in her mind was a picture of
the little stone church in her own land where
she had so often knelt in prayer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; she murmured at last. &ldquo;Tomorrow
as I try to tell to the world in pictures
the story of simple, kindly folks who live in
the mountains, I shall do it better because of
having been here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>For a long time they sat on the grass beneath
the elms. A gray squirrel came down a
tree to chatter at them. A robin, whose nest
was in a nearby lilac bush, sang them a song.
A cricket chirped. From far away came a
dog&rsquo;s bark. A cobweb went floating high overhead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; Jeanne whispered reluctantly.
&ldquo;We must go back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night as she sat looking out into the
half darkness of the night, Jeanne saw again
in her mind&rsquo;s eye the girl in a nile-green dress
and golden slippers. And as before, the green
changed its shade and became a sloping hill
where broad elms sighed in the breeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be no nile-green dress and golden
slippers,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Instead, if success
is ours, Jensie shall go to that so beautiful
college where they sing that which they
believe and ask such wonderful prayers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And down in her heart of hearts she knew
that she would strive harder for success than
ever before, because she was working for another&rsquo;s
happiness and not entirely for her own.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXII</span>
<br />BENEATH THE FLOODLIGHTS</h2>
<p>This brief period of rest was the last Petite
Jeanne was to enjoy for many days.
The work on that little section of Big Black
Mountain progressed more rapidly than had
been expected. In order that the re-making
of the scenario should progress quite as rapidly,
Tom Tobin secured a brief leave of absence
from his newspaper work. He and
Jeanne, together with Jensie when she could
be spared from her beloved Tavern, were together
at all hours of day and night.</p>
<p>So long as Tom was with her, Jeanne had
no fear of Lorena LeMar&rsquo;s boy friends. Her
only fear was that they might discover that
she was not Miss LeMar at all, and end by
betraying her secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what do you care!&rdquo; Tom exploded one
day. &ldquo;You are as good as Lorena LeMar.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not in pictures!&rdquo; Jeanne protested. &ldquo;No,
no! And then you know I have promised. I
said, &lsquo;Yes, I will be Lorena LeMar.&rsquo; And
Lorena LeMar I must be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was with grave misgiving that she approached
the movie lot on the first day of
actual work. &ldquo;There is so much I do not
know,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;If it is necessary to
explain much to me, what must that sharp-eyed
Mr. Soloman think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These fears vanished as she saw the rows
on rows of faces packed in the stadium ready
to witness the actual making of a movie feature,
for it was this and nothing less that the
keen Mr. Soloman had advertised in big electric
words outside the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must succeed! I must! I must!&rdquo; She set
her will to the task.</p>
<p>To her vast surprise she found that first day
passing as serenely as a journey down a country
lane. The scenes were simple ones, the
lines short and easy. She came to it all with
a simple naturalness that pleased both Soloman
and her audience.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>But, as the days passed, it seemed to her
that the whole affair was like a gigantic machine
that gathers speed as its many wheels
revolve.</p>
<p>Not three days had passed ere every person
in the cast realized that here was a real task,
the making of a genuine feature in record time
on an improvised stage. &ldquo;Seldom has it been
done,&rdquo; they were told. &ldquo;All the more reason
for succeeding,&rdquo; came their answer.</p>
<p>Powerful lights were hung over the mountain
and long after the spectators were gone
the cast of the play toiled on.</p>
<p>Important scenes were filmed not once or
twice, but six, eight, ten times. Each little
detail must be right.</p>
<p>Those burning lights burned into Jeanne&rsquo;s
very soul. What matter this? She must smile.
She must weep. She must shout for pure joy
when the script said, smile, weep, shout.</p>
<p>And all this time she felt the small eyes of
Soloman upon her. At times his eyes merely
twinkled; at others his lips curled in a smile.
Then again he seemed anxious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>When, on rare occasions, he broke the silence
to murmur, &ldquo;Beautiful! Beautiful!&rdquo; she
knew that the praise came from the very
depths of his soul and she was glad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he know that I am not Lorena LeMar?&rdquo;
she said to Tom one night. &ldquo;He must!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-no. Well, perhaps. I am sure he does
not know who you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if he did?&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s heart stood still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If God found a human as perfect as you
are mixed with the angels,&rdquo; Tom smiled, &ldquo;I
think He would let that human remain with
the angels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Soloman is not God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s no fool either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left it at that, but Jeanne did not cease,
at times, to tremble.</p>
<p>There was no picture on the clouds these
days. So weary was she when at last each
day was done, that she crept away to Lorena
LeMar&rsquo;s sumptuous apartment to sleep the
hours away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>The long-eared Chinaman, the three-bladed
knife, the hearse and the two black horses,
Rutledge Tavern, even the laundry bag
checked in the little hotel were for the moment
crowded out of her life.</p>
<p>And then came the marvelous news that
they were to board a special car and speed
away to the real mountains.</p>
<p>So weary was Jeanne, by the time she
reached that car, that she crept beneath the
blankets in her berth and did not awaken until
the morning sun and the green hills of Kentucky
greeted her eyes.</p>
<p>At noon of that same day Jeanne found herself
seated on a great rock at the foot of Big
Black Mountain. She was dressed in boys&rsquo;
unionalls. Her feet were bare. On her head,
slouched down about her ears, she wore an old
straw hat. Gripped in both hands was a fishing
rod made from the branch of a chestnut
tree. She was fishing, fishing joyously for
&ldquo;green perch.&rdquo; What mattered it that a movie
camera was clicking across the stream, or that
the villain of the movie tried in vain to talk to
her of love? All this was but play stuff. The
fishing was real.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>When the fishing was over she dived, clothes
and all, into that deep, limpid pool to enjoy a
glorious swim while the camera clicked on,
and from time to time Ted Hunter, the director,
shouted &ldquo;Cut! Cut!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; Jeanne whispered to Jensie when
the day was over and they stood before a
spring dashing handfuls of clear, cool water
over their faces, &ldquo;This is not work! It is play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it seemed to them all. Catching the
spirit of the mountains, of the easy-going,
beauty-loving, loyal people of the Cumberlands,
they dreamed the hours away. Only
Ted Hunter&rsquo;s sharp &ldquo;No! No! Not that!&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Yes! Yes! That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; made them realize that
they were making a moving picture.</p>
<p>As for the members of the company, in this
mellow atmosphere Jeanne came to love them
all. Anthony Hope, the droll, handsome youth
who in the first and last scenes of the movie
made bashful love to her; Scott Ramsey, the
aged character actor; Pietro, the young Italian;
and even the chubby villain came to have
a safe little spot in Jeanne&rsquo;s generous heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>There were hours off. And what could be
more delightful than to don those boys&rsquo; overalls
once more and with Pietro as guard
against bears, to climb far up the side of Big
Black Mountain?</p>
<p>Having climbed and climbed until they had
lost their breath, they came at last upon a
lovely spot where the sunlight, sifting through
the leafy bower above, wove strange patterns
in the moss.</p>
<p>There Pietro threw himself flat upon nature&rsquo;s
soft bed to stare up at an eagle wheeling
high in the sky. It was then that he spoke
to her, sometimes calmly, sometimes passionately,
of his hopes, his dreams and his moments
of black despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think I was born in Italy!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;I was not, but in Chicago. Not
beautiful Chicago, but ugly Chicago, the near
West Side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are seven of us. Three boys. Four
girls. I am the oldest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I studied hard. I graduated from High
School. And then what? Nothing. I tramped
the streets looking for work, any work. There
was no work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One month, two, three, four, five months!&rdquo;
His voice took on a bitter note. &ldquo;Six months
I tramped the streets! No work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;I will get tough. I will join the 42
Gang.&rsquo; I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! Never! You would not!&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s
tone was deep with emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not so much that I would not.&rdquo;
Pietro sat up. &ldquo;It was that I <i>could</i> not. My
people were honest. I could not steal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then&mdash;&rdquo; His voice mellowed. &ldquo;Then
I met a fat little Jew. He said, &lsquo;Come with me,
my boy. I will give you a chance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not wish to go. I said to myself, &lsquo;He
is a Jew. A Jew!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what was there to do?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went. He has taught me how to act in
pictures, this little Jew, your friend, my friend,
Mr. Soloman.&rdquo; There was a touch almost of
reverence in his voice. &ldquo;And now, here I am,&rdquo;
he concluded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And, Miss LeMar&mdash;&rdquo; His eyes appeared
to look into her very soul. So deep was her
feeling at that moment that she actually feared
he was reading her true name from her very
eyes. But he was not. &ldquo;Miss LeMar,&rdquo; he repeated
softly, &ldquo;tell me that this picture, this
&lsquo;Dogwood in Bloom&rsquo; story, is to be a success,
a real success!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pietro,&rdquo; her hand was on his arm, &ldquo;if you
and I and all the rest can make it a success,
then it shall be&mdash;a grand, a very glorious success.
I can say no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Putting out a hand, solemn as a priest in a
temple, he lifted her white fingers to his lips
and kissed them.</p>
<p>Then, as if a little ashamed, he sprang to his
feet to lead the way back down the mountain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIII</span>
<br />GOLDEN DAYS</h2>
<p>It was night. All alone Jeanne sat upon the
side of that man-made section of Big Black
Mountain there on the studio lot in Chicago.
The faint light that reached her, coming from
afar, served only to intensify the shadows of
trees and shrubs all about her.</p>
<p>It was perfect, this bit of Big Black Mountain.
The trees, the shrubs, the rocks, the little
rushing stream, all were perfect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfect,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;And the picture
we have been making, will it be perfect, too?&rdquo;
Her brow wrinkled. She was to know. To-night
was the great night. The picture was
finished. To-night came the preview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At midnight,&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;Midnight,
one o&rsquo;clock, and after that my hour of enchantment.
Shall it truly be? Shall&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>She broke short off to cast a hurried glance
up the slope above her. Had she caught some
sound, the snapping of a twig, the rolling of a
stone?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps nothing,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;I am
excited. This is a grand night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah, yes, this was the night of nights. Two
weeks had passed since Lorena LeMar had
walked out of her richly furnished apartment
and Jeanne had walked in.</p>
<p>Two weeks, fourteen days, and such days
as they had been! Jeanne sighed as she
thought of it now. And yet her lips were able
to form the words &ldquo;Golden Days.&rdquo; They had
been just that, beautiful, glorious, golden days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is perfect, this mountain,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;Even in the dark one senses the beauty of it.
Ah, the rushing cold water, the scent of mountain
ivy, the glint of sunbeams through the
trees!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, it was a perfect little corner of Big
Black Mountain, but the little French girl&rsquo;s
thoughts were far away. They had wandered
to the spot where Big Black Mountain itself
stretched away, away and away until its glorious
green turned to blue that blended with
a cloudless sky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>She was thinking of Pietro who rode a donkey
so badly he had actually fallen off more
than once, and who sang his Italian songs so
divinely.</p>
<p>She was thinking of Tom Tobin and wondering
vaguely which of the two she liked
best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want the picture to be a success for
them,&rdquo; she whispered. Her words were almost
a prayer. &ldquo;Oh, God, make the critics kind!
It is for them, for Pietro and Jensie, for Old
Scott Ramsey, for Soloman and&mdash;and for
Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom had been with her on her visit to Big
Black Mountain. Yes, Tom had gone, for by
this time the story of the possible success of a
real feature written by a Chicago boy and
being filmed at Chicago&rsquo;s front door had become
town talk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>There had been publicity. &ldquo;Ah, yes, such
publicity!&rdquo; she sighed. Every day for a week
her picture had appeared in the paper. She
had been shown among the dogwood blossoms
on the movie lot, on the Enchanted Island with
a hundred beautiful children crowding about
her, in a gondola riding down the lagoon like
a queen. Ah, yes, there had been publicity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And always,&rdquo; she breathed, &ldquo;I am not Petite
Jeanne at all, but Lorena LeMar. Ah, well,
what can it matter? To-day one is a queen,
to-morrow she is forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And besides&mdash;&rdquo; She smiled a bit wearily.
&ldquo;Besides, how shall I say it? This picture
may, after all, be a flop, and if it is, then it is
Lorena LeMar who has failed and not I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again a little tremor shot up her spine. She
<i>had</i> caught a sound above her. She half rose
as if to flee. But the night was warm. The
day had been a hard one. It was good to be
alone. Soon the floodlights would be turned
on, the press men with their cameras would be
here. To-night was the preview of that much
talked of picture, &ldquo;When the Dogwood Is in
Bloom.&rdquo; It had been arranged that the showing
should take place in the Children&rsquo;s Theatre
on the Enchanted Island of the Fair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is no one up there.&rdquo; She settled
back. &ldquo;Only a few moments more to think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strangely enough, her thoughts for a moment
whirled through a score of mysteries,
the hearse and the two black horses in the dark
night, the organ that played its own tunes, the
three-bladed knife, the long-eared Chinaman,
all these remained as mysteries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But these,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;these are not
for to-night. To-morrow or the day after, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, were they not, though? One may not
always elect the hour for the unfolding of
life&rsquo;s mysteries. Fate at times takes a hand.</p>
<p>But one may choose the subject of one&rsquo;s own
thoughts. Jeanne chose to think of the real
Big Black Mountain. What a glorious time
she had down there in the hills of Kentucky!
Climbing steep slopes, she had dropped upon
beds of moss to catch the call of a yellow-hammer
or the chatter of a squirrel.</p>
<p>At night she had sat for long hours before
a narrow home-made fireplace, to creep at last
beneath home-woven blankets, and with Jensie
at her side to sleep the long night through.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>That had lasted only two days. And then
back to the city they were whirled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must go back!&rdquo; the producer had exclaimed.
&ldquo;The public is clamoring for a look
at the task we are at, making a feature right
in Chicago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The public had been there. Every afternoon,
as they worked at the unfolding of this tense
drama, the stadium had been packed.</p>
<p>The picture had grown, too. Under the inspiration
of the hour, new fragments of plot
were added, new scenes sprang into being. A
mountain feud was added. The scene in a
mansion which Jeanne suggested had sprung
into being. A friend of Lorena LeMar, a rich
society fan of the movies, had thrown her
home open to them. And there in the midst
of the greatest splendor Jeanne had tripped
with dainty feet down a winding marble staircase,
only to cast aside her silken finery at
last and don her calico gown to go stealing
out of the mansion and borrow a ride in a box
car back to her beloved mountains.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>All this had become part of the thing they
were making. Working at white heat, inspired
by one grand idea that success was to be
achieved where failure had been expected, they
had poured their very lives into the business
of creating a thing of beauty that in the hearts
of men would be a joy forever.</p>
<p>Never, even in the good days of light opera,
had Jeanne so thoroughly lost herself in the
thing she was doing. Day and night she lived,
moved and breathed as Zola, the mountain
girl.</p>
<p>She had worked untiringly, not so much for
herself as for others. Once again she had gathered
about her a golden circle of friends. Pietro,
Soloman, Tom, Jensie, Scott Ramsey, all
these and many others were included in her
Golden Circle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now&mdash;&rdquo; She caught a short breath as
she sat there among the trees. &ldquo;Now we have
done all that can be done. To-night we shall
know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We shall know.&rdquo; How her heart raced.
Not one foot of that film had she seen thrown
upon the screen. To-night she was to see it
all&mdash;the picture she had made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t wait!&rdquo; She sprang to her feet.</p>
<p>At that instant floodlights flashed on. Instantly
night was turned into day.</p>
<p>Involuntarily she glanced in the direction
from which that disturbing sound had come.</p>
<p>It was only by exerting the utmost of will
power that she avoided screaming. There,
crouching with the three-bladed knife in his
hand, not ten feet away, was the long-eared
Chinaman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must not scream! I will not!&rdquo; She shut
her lips tight.</p>
<p>She looked again. <i>He was gone.</i></p>
<p>Scarcely believing her eyes, she stood staring
at the spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must not say a word,&rdquo; she whispered to
herself. &ldquo;This is to be the big night. There
must be no scene! No hue and cry, no wild
man-hunt! No! No! No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And there was none.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>Five minutes later when the photographers
came to take one more picture of the &ldquo;Queen&rdquo;
on the mountainside, she stood calm and smiling
as a June bride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think,&rdquo; she said to Tom Tobin when
this ordeal was over, &ldquo;to-morrow this beautiful
mountain will be a thing of the past! Not
one stick, nor stone, nor even a handful of
earth will remain. To-morrow a new picture
is to begin, a desert scene, new director, new
cast, new setting, a brand new movie world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sort of life-like,&rdquo; Tom philosophized. &ldquo;We
move a little slower, stay a little longer on this
good, green earth, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, but to-night let us forget.&rdquo; Jeanne
gripped his arm impulsively. &ldquo;This, my friend,
is our big moment, yours and mine. Let us
dream for a moment, hope for an hour. Let
us dare hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;&rdquo; Her voice dropped to a whisper.
&ldquo;And if it is not too much, let us pray a little.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIV</span>
<br />THE BATTLE IN THE ORANGE GROVE</h2>
<p>It was Florence who next saw the mysterious
Chinaman, and that not an hour from
the time he disappeared from Jeanne&rsquo;s delectable
mountain. Her day&rsquo;s work at an end, she
had retired to the orange grove on the banks
of the lagoon for a short period of rest. She
had been here often of late. There was something
very unusual and charming about this
orange grove thriving here in the very front
yard of Chicago.</p>
<p>The place was in reality a tropical garden.
As she lay there, propped up on an elbow, the
fragrance of tropical flowers, the pungent odor
of ripe tropical fruit suggested that she might
be thousands of miles from her native city, at
the edge of some Central American jungle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>And yet, as she opened her eyes to look
away across the lagoon, her eyes told her that
she was in truth at the very heart of a fantastical
world of play.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How like a theatre it is!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>And indeed, as she allowed her eyes to follow
the lagoon until it lost itself in the broader
waters of the lake, she found them filled with
the ever-changing lights of a stage on opening
night. Gayly decorated barges drawn by small
power boats drifted past. A bevy of girls, all
garbed in gowns of bright red, shot past in a
speed boat. They were singing, &ldquo;Sailing!
Sailing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From a floating platform came the martial
music of a band. Overhead an airplane motor
droned. The plane was shooting out a spiral
of smoke. The smoke formed itself into clouds
and on these clouds there played living, moving
pictures.</p>
<p>As she lay there on the grass, head
propped on elbow, watching, dreaming, like
Petite Jeanne, she caught an unusual sound.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not far away,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Over there
among the banana leaves, perhaps.&rdquo; She
thought of investigating this. But she was
tired, and as she had promised to wait for
Jeanne&rsquo;s preview she wished to rest.</p>
<p>So she dismissed the matter from her mind
and once again allowed her mind to drift.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful spot, this,&rdquo; she whispered to
herself. &ldquo;Probably never be seen in Chicago
again, orange trees loaded with fruits and
flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was true. With endless pains men had
grown trees in boxes, then had shipped them
to the Fair. There were lemon trees, and mangoes,
and tall trees that grew tropical melons.
In one spot there was a perfect tangle of tropical
vegetation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and banana trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again her eyes were upon that cluster
of banana trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There <i>is</i> something moving there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Getting a grip on herself, she kept up the
semblance of dreaming. In reality she was
very much alert, quite alive&mdash;watching.</p>
<p>Nor did she watch in vain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>As she watched, fascinated, waiting for she
knew not what, ready on the instant to go
dashing away, she saw the banana leaves stir,
move to one side, then fall back into their
original position.</p>
<p>Every muscle in her splendid body was tense
now. Had she caught a glimpse of a face? She
believed so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, one is so easily deceived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She should leave the place. This was plain
enough; yet stubbornly she stayed.</p>
<p>She watched the darting rocket cars as they
flashed across the sky, followed the course of
an airplane by its spark of light, allowed her
mind to wander for an instant to Jeanne and
her problems. But all the time she was thinking,
&ldquo;I must be on my guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With all this, when at last the banana leaves
parted and a form crept out, she was surprised
beyond measure. She recognized the person
on the instant. The very stealth of his movements
gave him away. It was the long-eared
Chinaman.</p>
<p>She gasped. &ldquo;Has he seen me?</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he has, he&rsquo;s playing a game.&rdquo; He did not
look her way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>Then it was that, as though it were some
picture on the clouds, she saw faces of children,
hundreds of faces, cute Chinese children,
and above them all, resolute, determined, hopeful,
the serious face of Erik Nord, the white
man from China.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Now I have you!&rdquo; Was it she who
thought this? Or was it Erik Nord thinking
through her? She did not pause for an answer.
Instead, she sprang squarely at the crouching
figure.</p>
<p>Her plan, if she might be said to have one,
was to snatch the precious three-bladed knife
from beneath his long coat, then to run for it.</p>
<p>In this she failed. With a panther-like
spring, the yellow man eluded her. Then, perceiving
perhaps that escape was impossible, he
took the offensive.</p>
<p>He did not draw the knife. There was not
time. Then, too, it was for demons, not for
men, nor for girls either. Instead, with a leap
and the swing of an arm he encircled her neck
in such a vice-like grip that for a space of ten
seconds she was helpless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You shall give the bell!&rdquo; he hissed. &ldquo;The
bell and the banners you shall give!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Too close to the point of strangulation to
reply or so much as think clearly, she placed
her hands against his chest, then suddenly
threw all her superb strength into one tremendous
thrust.</p>
<p>Did she hear a bone crack in his wrist? Was
her own neck being broken?</p>
<p>For a space of seconds, with head ready to
burst, she could not tell. Then, with a sighing
groan the intruder relaxed his hold and all but
fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Following up this advantage she fell toward
him in such a manner as to start him rolling
down the hill. And then, all in a flash, she
caught a gleam of white on the grass at her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The knife! The three-bladed knife! If
only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>With one more tremendous push she set the
yellow man into a spin that landed him with a
splash into the water of the lagoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He swims well enough,&rdquo; she assured herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>Then, with heart thumping wildly, she
snatched up the much coveted knife with the
jeweled hilt and went sprinting away up the
slope, away to the south and across the bridge
over the lagoon, to lose herself at last in a
throng that had gathered about a wandering
Egyptian street fakir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I lost him?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>The answer, though she could not know it
now, was &ldquo;Yes, but not for long.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXV</span>
<br />ONCE AGAIN THE ORGAN PLAYS AT MIDNIGHT</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I promised to wait for Jeanne on
Byrd&rsquo;s Polar Ship,&rdquo; she recalled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
go there now. Peter Nordsen, the watchman,
will be there. People will be passing through.
It will be safe enough now.&rdquo; She had hidden
the three-bladed knife beneath her blouse. For
all this, she did not feel quite easy about it.</p>
<p>To her surprise, when she arrived at the spot
where the ship had been moored she found it
gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; she exclaimed in surprise.</p>
<p>This surprise lasted but an instant. &ldquo;Oh! I
forgot. There was a parade of ships on the
lake to-day. Byrd&rsquo;s ship was in that parade.
It will be tied up outside the bridge. The mast
must come down before she&rsquo;ll go under the
bridge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo; she exulted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a good
rest on the old ship with no one about but old
Peter Nordsen smoking his pipe. If Jeanne
doesn&rsquo;t show up I&rsquo;ll go to the little theatre at
midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She found the ship readily enough, gave
Peter a smile and a &ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; then went
forward to a seat well up in the prow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sturdy old ship!&rdquo; she murmured as she
sank into the chair. Then she relaxed in a
fit attitude for dreaming.</p>
<p>She had learned to love this old ship. It was
easy to imagine it in motion, booming along
with all sails set before a nor&rsquo;west wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old ship!&rdquo; she murmured again. &ldquo;If
only I could sail with you over the seven seas.
Australia, the South Sea Islands, Japan, China
and&mdash;&rdquo; She drew a deep breath. &ldquo;That mysterious
land, China.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought quite suddenly of the jewel-hilted
knife. &ldquo;I should hunt up Erik Nord and
give it to him at once,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;But
then, I have no notion where he is; he went
off duty an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>She laughed a little low laugh as she thought
of the Chinaman splashing in the water of the
lagoon. Then, of a sudden there came a
thought that puzzled her. &ldquo;He said we had the
bell and the banners. How absurd! The chest
was empty. They were gone. Who could have
taken them if he did not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thought did not remain with her. No
thought did. This was an hour for relaxation
and dreaming. But she must not dream too
long. This was Jeanne&rsquo;s big night. She must
not miss it. &ldquo;Jeanne&rsquo;s big night,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>She allowed her eyes to wander once more
over the magnificent spectacle that lay before
her. What a sight! Fountains playing amid
golden walls, a hundred lights gleaming as
white as diamonds from a lofty tower, trees
turning red and gold under the touch of many-hued
lamps, and a ladder of light towering
skyward. All this exercised upon this impressionable
girl a semi-hypnotic spell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must not forget. This is Jeanne&rsquo;s big
night. I must not be late. I&mdash;I will not fail&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>For all that, her head sank lower and lower.
The day had been a long one. The battle in
the orange grove had drawn heavily from her
reserve of energy. The hypnotic spell of night
and the ever-changing panorama of light sank
deep. She nodded twice, then her head fell
slowly forward. She was asleep.</p>
<p>Along the breakwater at that moment there
glided a mysterious figure. By his nervous
stops and starts one might judge him to be in
a high state of nervous excitement. Yet there
was in his movements a suggestion of extreme
caution.</p>
<p>As he came near to the spot where the Polar
ship lay anchored, he came to a sudden halt,
stood there for a full moment as if rooted to
the spot, then dashed away at full speed.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>At this moment Jeanne was standing with
Jensie at the back of the Rutledge Tavern.
They were looking out into the night. As if
for mutual protection, they had their arms
locked tightly together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There it is!&rdquo; Jensie whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hearse!&rdquo; Jeanne shuddered.</p>
<p>And there most certainly it was, standing
in the moonlight just as it had been on that
first memorable night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; Jeanne whispered to herself,
&ldquo;much has happened since then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were all here at the Tavern, her little
company. They had come here for a late dinner;
Soloman, Anthony Hope, Scott Ramsey,
Pietro, Tom and Jensie were by the fireplace.</p>
<p>Now as Jeanne felt the urge to retreat she
said to Jensie in a tone that came from down
deep in her throat, &ldquo;There were two black
horses and a coffin. I saw them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jensie agreed. &ldquo;There were. And,
Jeanne,&rdquo; her voice took on an air of mystery,
&ldquo;last night the organ played again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It played again?&rdquo; Looking into the mountain
girl&rsquo;s eyes, Jeanne thought she detected
there a curious unwonted gleam, but she said
not another word as they wandered back to
their place by the fireside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<h2 id="c26"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXVI</span>
<br />CARRIED AWAY IN THE NIGHT</h2>
<p>Florence awoke with a start. She
sprang to her feet. Where was she? She
knew on the instant, or thought she knew.
But truly, where <i>was</i> she? Cold fear gripped
her heart. All the bright glory of the Fair,
the changing lights, splashing fountains, clashing
rocket cars had faded into mere nothing,
a dull blue against the horizon.</p>
<p>Was she going blind? Men had gone blind
in just that way. She rubbed her eyes, then
looked at her hand. She could see it, indistinctly
it is true, but with plenty of detail.</p>
<p>She looked over the rail. Black water was
all about her. The old ship swayed slightly.
To her ears there came the sound of a motor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this old ship has no motor. Byrd took
it out before he passed through the Panama
Canal.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>For all this, she was convinced that the ship
was in motion. She looked up. Masts, but no
sails.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tow! Some one is giving it a tow!&rdquo; Once
again her blood chilled. There had been no
plans for moving the ship; this she knew. The
old night watchman had said that the masts
would be lowered during the night and the
ship would be brought back within the lagoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this? What can it mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had not long to wait. A light came
swinging forward. A gas lantern, it was carried
by a short man. Two others were just
behind him.</p>
<p>As they came into view she gasped. The
leader of the trio was the long-eared Chinaman.
The others were his fellow-countrymen.
As if sure of his ground, he advanced slowly.
There was something sinister, deadly, about
that slow advance, like a march of death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caught!&rdquo; Her head whirled. She thought
of leaping overboard. A strong swimmer, she
might make land. But the blur of red and gold
that was the Fair was dim, indistinct.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re far off shore.&rdquo; Taking a grip on herself,
she held her ground.</p>
<p>She took to counting the short, gliding steps
of those who approached. &ldquo;One, two, three,
four, five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They came to a halt. The leader advanced
two steps farther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will give me that knife!&rdquo; His tone
was low, smooth, musical, menacing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Her tone was defiant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water is deep; the distance is very far.&rdquo;
His tone had not changed. &ldquo;You will give me
the knife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This knife is for Chinaman. Very old, that
knife.&rdquo; His body rocked slowly back and forth.
His voice rose in a sort of chant. &ldquo;Very powerful,
that knife. Not fight man, that knife.
Fight demons. Very &rsquo;fraid demons. Wave that
knife, ring that bell, demons gone. You have
that bell. You also give bell, give banners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not have the banners or the bell.
But if we had, you should not have them.&rdquo;
Florence held her ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You not speak truth. You have bell, have
banners. You will give. The water is deep.
The distance is far.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long time fight demons, that knife.&rdquo; He
was chanting again. &ldquo;Far away, back very far
in China, people all happy, all demons &rsquo;fraid,
stay away. Priests of Buddha fight demons,
that knife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White man take knife, take bell, take banners.
Now demons come back. Make people
sick, those demons. Many people die. No
knife, no bell, no banners, can&rsquo;t fight demons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very dry, no rain. No millet, no rice. Demons
make land dry. No knife, no bell, no
banner. Can&rsquo;t fight demons. I come for knife.
He come. He come.&rdquo; He nodded at his statue-like
companions. &ldquo;Come for knife, for bell, for
banners. You give.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s figure stiffened. &ldquo;You will
not get the knife. I do not have those others.
You have them. You stole them. The chest
was empty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All you have said is nonsense!&rdquo; Her voice
rose. &ldquo;Demons do not make men die. If your
people are sick they should go to the white
doctor. He will cure them. All those things,
the knife, the bell, the banners were sold for
money, much money. That money would buy
things for the white doctor. You have no right
to them. You stole them. You have them all
but the knife. You will not get the knife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water is deep. The distance is very
far. You will give the knife!&rdquo; He advanced a
step. Without appearing to move their feet,
the statue-like pair advanced.</p>
<p>The whole scene, the dark ship, the menacing
men, the water, the night, was so like a
play that Florence could scarcely believe her
senses.</p>
<p>Then to her alert ears came a sound, a low
chant:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hey, yuh! A hey, yuh! A hey, yuh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had heard that sound before. But
where? For ten seconds she wracked her
brain. Then she knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; She endeavored to speak quietly.
&ldquo;You believe in demons. Listen! What do
you hear?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>The long-eared one stood rigid, silent, listening.</p>
<p>The sound grew louder: &ldquo;A hey, yuh! A
hey, yuh! A hey, yuh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believe in demons,&rdquo; she repeated.
&ldquo;Well, here are demons for you, black demons
with long knives in their belts. They are coming
to rescue me. And let me tell you, you will
need a hundred three-bladed knives to frighten
these away, and men to use the knives. You
are only three. They are many. They are big,
black!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The menacing ones and the statues glided
back a step.</p>
<p>The sound they had heard was the chant of
a crew of black men from the heart of Africa.
A part of this great carnival, they were practicing
in their forty-foot dugout, a hollow log
boat, for a race.</p>
<p>What she had said was, she supposed, pure
fiction. Now her courage forsook her. They
were not coming for her. They would pass a
long way off. They would turn and go back
before they came within hailing distance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>For once luck was with her. What she had
said was true. Jeanne, having come in search
of her, had found the ship gone and had seen
a frantic watchman, who had left the ship &ldquo;but
for one short breathing spell,&rdquo; racing up and
down the breakwater.</p>
<p>At that instant the boatload of black men
hove into view. Fearing treachery, Jeanne had
begged them to take her in search of the missing
ship.</p>
<p>So now here they were, out on the dark waters
of night. The watchman in the prow,
twenty black men from the heart of Africa at
the oars, and the golden-haired Petite Jeanne
urging them on and shouting with them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hey, yuh! A hey, yuh! A hey, yuh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was no time at all before it became plain
that their destination was the misplaced ship.
And at this the three yellow men vanished.
Came the sound of a boat&rsquo;s motor throbbing.
Then that sound grew fainter and fainter in
the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are gone!&rdquo; Florence breathed. &ldquo;And
I still have the knife!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<h2 id="c27"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXVII</span>
<br />HER BIG NIGHT</h2>
<p>It was the crew of smiling blacks who carried
Florence and Jeanne back to shore. A
stout little tug came out for the Polar ship, but
that was too slow for them.</p>
<p>With oars flashing in the moonlight, with
their crew chanting a weird song, they went
sweeping back to Jeanne&rsquo;s &ldquo;Big Night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All their friends, the movie company, Tom
Tobin and even Erik Nord were waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it,&rdquo; Florence whispered to Erik.
&ldquo;The three-bladed knife.&rdquo; She slipped it into
his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; He gripped her hand. &ldquo;But
the bell? The banners?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something strange about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She told him briefly as they hurried along
with the others to the little theatre.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never see him again,&rdquo; Erik said with
conviction. &ldquo;The emigration officers are on his
trail. They&rsquo;ll get him. He&rsquo;ll go back to China.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; Florence spoke in a low,
serious tone, &ldquo;I feel rather sorry for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, one does. But that is often so in
China. The old is losing out, the new is coming.
That is always sad. But it must be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were at the theatre entrance.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Once, while Jeanne, still quite a young girl,
was traveling with the gypsies a man had
asked permission to take her picture as she
danced with the bear. Proudly she had posed
for the camera man. That had been spring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the autumn when you return this way
you shall see your picture,&rdquo; the kindly white-haired
photographer had said to her.</p>
<p>She recalled all that now as she sat in the
little theatre waiting for the preview of her
picture to begin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;How thrilled I was
when at last we returned to that village and I
was permitted to see that picture! But this!
How much more wonderful! But, perhaps&mdash;how
terrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And indeed, what an occasion was this!
Never before had she seen herself in motion.
Never had she heard her own voice after the
sound had been allowed to grow cold. And
now, now she was to see and hear a feature
never before shown on the screen. And in this
feature she was the star. Each act, each movement,
every little habit of gesture, yes, almost
of thought, was recorded here. Her very book
of life was to be opened up before her, or so
she believed. And not before herself alone was
she to appear, but to an assembled group of
notable people. There were rich men and their
wives, friends of the producer. There were reporters
and critics. By the judgment of these
last the picture must stand or fall. Little wonder
then that she actually shuddered and
leaned hard on Florence&rsquo;s arm as Ted Hunter,
the director, stepped into the spotlight to make
the accustomed announcement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>It seemed that there were to be still some
moments of suspense. They had made, Ted
Hunter announced, a very short mystery reel
which they would now run as a curtain-raiser
to the main event.</p>
<p>Too much overcome by thoughts of the immediate
future to focus her attention on this
mystery, Jeanne watched with half closed
eyes until with a sudden start she sat straight
up, to grip Jensie&rsquo;s arm and whisper shrilly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jensie! Only look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no need for this. Jensie had seen
and was staring hard, for upon the screen there
walked with solemn tread two black horses.
They were hitched to an ancient, dilapidated
hearse, and on that hearse there rested a
coffin.</p>
<p>That this was a part of the mystery Jeanne
knew, but what that part was she could not
guess. She had not followed the plot. One
thing was plain and this she whispered to
Jensie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the old hearse. It belongs back of
the Tavern in the Lincoln Group. They&mdash;they
must have borrowed it for this picture. They
took it in the night. That was the time I saw
the black horses and the coffin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And you know that organ?&rdquo; the
mountain girl whispered back. &ldquo;I found out
about that. It was a colored girl who washes
dishes at the Tavern. She loves music, so she
hid in the closet and slipped out to play the
organ at night. I&mdash;I caught her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh&mdash;sh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mystery was over. Once again Ted
Hunter was in the spotlight&rsquo;s glare. The great
moment was at hand.</p>
<p>Never will Jeanne forget the hour that followed.
From a distance she heard the motor
hum. Next instant she saw herself upon the
screen. One good look, ten seconds, she saw
herself. Then she, Petite Jeanne, vanished.
In her place, standing among the rhododendrons
at the side of Big Black Mountain was
Zola the child of that mountain.</p>
<p>All that hour she looked upon the screen,
listened and lived with Zola. She laughed
when it was time to laugh, wept when others
wept and shouted as they shouted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>And when the camera gave its last click,
when the screen went white and the lights
flashed on, she said to herself, &ldquo;It was not I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet, even as she sat there they crowded
about her, the members of the cast of that picture,
the reporters, the critics. They lifted her
to their shoulders, carried her to the platform,
set her on her feet, and shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speech! Speech!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speech? Her head was in a wild whirl.</p>
<p>Then her eyes fell upon the clock. &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;
She held up a hand for silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Her voice rose like a captain&rsquo;s
shouting a command. A hush, the hush that
can come only at two in the morning, fell over
the group. But into that hush there came no
unusual sound, only the distant chimes heralding
the hour of two in the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My hour of enchantment!&rdquo; Jeanne sighed
blissfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you listen!&rdquo; It was Florence who
spoke. &ldquo;I have heard you say that many times.
What do you mean&mdash;your hour of enchantment?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo; The little French
girl&rsquo;s face beamed. &ldquo;Long ago a gypsy woman,
a very old and very wise fortune teller, said
to me, &lsquo;Your hour of enchantment is two
o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You too,&rdquo; she hurried on, &ldquo;each one of you
has an enchanted hour&mdash;an hour when wonderful
things will come to you; good fortune,
riches, a proposal, marriage, all these will come
to you on that enchanted hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true!&rdquo; She was deeply in earnest, this
little French girl, so sincerely in earnest that
she did not realize that she was about to betray
a secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think it strange that my enchanted
hour is two in the morning when most good
people are in their beds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are forgetting that I am at heart a
gypsy, that indeed I once <i>was</i> a gypsy, a
French gypsy, a very good gypsy.&rdquo; She smiled.
&ldquo;But a gypsy all the same.&rdquo; At this instant
the lips of Mr. Soloman parted in a low exclamation
of excitement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So that is who you are!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;You are the little French girl, Petite Jeanne!
For days I have wracked my brain saying to
myself, &lsquo;She is not Lorena LeMar. Who is
she?&rsquo; And now look! You are Petite Jeanne,
the star of my most wonderful picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Soloman!&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s arms came
perilously near encircling his fat neck. &ldquo;You
knew I was a fraud, and yet you let me go on!
How&mdash;how so very wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fraud!&rdquo; he thundered. &ldquo;No! I did not
know you were a fraud. I knew you were a
very great star.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Miss Jeanne,&rdquo; his voice became
confidential, &ldquo;your name will go on that picture
and in the lights of every Broadway of
the land, for it was you who made that picture,
not Lorena LeMar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Jeanne caught her breath. &ldquo;Do you
think that would be right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes! Yes!&rdquo; came in screams from
the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what a story that will make!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; the producer turned to a group of
reporters, &ldquo;those pictures you took, they must
go with the greatest story of all time, the story
of a double who in two short weeks became a
star.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes! You bet! Rah, rah, for Jeanne!&rdquo;
came from the reporters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Miss Jeanne.&rdquo; Soloman drew a
paper from his pocket. &ldquo;Here is a contract for
you. We have made you&mdash;no, no, you have
made yourself&mdash;a star; and of course you will
make another picture; many, many more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; Jeanne pressed the paper back into
his hand, &ldquo;not to-night. My head is in a whirl.
Perhaps never at all, but surely not to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow then. I can wait.&rdquo; The great
little man folded his paper neatly and thrust
it deep in his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This moving picture,&rdquo; said Jeanne, still
feeling that she must make a speech. &ldquo;It is
beautiful. I have seen. You have seen. It is
truly beautiful. But it is not I who have made
it. It is you, my friends, Mr. Soloman, Pietro,
Anthony, Scott Ramsey and all the rest. It is
the spirit of those so beautiful mountains. It
is the soul of that so great American, Mr. Lincoln.
It is every one. It is everything. It is
not I.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she murmured after the applause
had died away, &ldquo;I am very tired. Will
you please take me home, not to that so grand
hotel but to the little rooms where my good
Florence and I have lived so happily. No
longer am I Lorena LeMar. I am only Petite
Jeanne, the gypsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more they bore her in triumph on their
shoulders, and tucked her away at last in the
taxi between Florence and Jensie, while Erik
Nord and Tom Tobin took their places on the
drop seats before her.</p>
<p>There was little left to be told. It was told
in the shabby third floor rooms that were the
private castle of Florence and Jeanne. With
Tom as her bodyguard Jeanne hurried to the
little hotel where she presented her check and
received in exchange her well filled laundry
bag.</p>
<p>When Tom had carried this to the top floor
room, she bade him pour its contents on the
floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Behold the bell, the banners!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;I have had them hidden away all
the time. Do not ask me why. I am a gypsy.
A gypsy needs no reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Mr. Nord, with my good friend&rsquo;s
permission, I return them to you. Florence
has told me of the cute Chinese children. May
they all get well speedily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the reward?&rdquo; Erik Nord looked from
Florence to Jeanne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence may have the reward,&rdquo; Jeanne responded
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will visit China?&rdquo; He smiled at
Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. Some time.&rdquo; She looked away
quickly.</p>
<p>Jensie went to college. Jeanne was called
back to France. The great Fair closed, as all
fairs do. So ended another year.</p>
<p>Did Jeanne return to America? Did she renew
her rightful claim of stardom in the movie
world? Did Florence indeed visit that &ldquo;mysterious
land, China&rdquo;? You may find the answer
in the next book, <i>The Phantom Violin</i>.</p>
